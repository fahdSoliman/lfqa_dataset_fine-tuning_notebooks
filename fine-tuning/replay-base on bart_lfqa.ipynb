caterpillars turn into liquid and then reform into a butterfly in the cocoon? or do they keep some of the same parts?', 'context': '<p> to begin the pupal or chrysalis stage, the caterpillar attaches itself with a silk pad and hangs upside down on a leaf. about 24 hours later, its skin splits, exposing a dull, bronze-coloured case known as the pupa or chrysalis. the pupa hangs for about a week without movement. within the pupa, the caterpillar is turning into liquid and changing into a butterfly, a process called metamorphosis.\\n <p> most moth caterpillars spin a cocoon made of silk within which they metamorphose into the pupal stage. most butterfly caterpillars, on the other hand, form an exposed pupa made from a hardened protein, also termed a chrysalis.\\n <p> once the caterpillars hatch, they are fairly solitary. they eat leaves from the edge inwards. the caterpillars eat from several host plants. caterpillars begin as yellow with black stripes, but become blue green over time. once they are blue green, they develop four red and one yellow protuberances. these caterpillars go through several instars or skin shedding, and usually after the fifth shedding the caterpillar is ready to form a cocoon. when the caterpillars form cocoons, they are twice as long as they are wide.\\n <p> the caterpillar is white in the early stage and turns yellow in the last instar. in its late stage, it is like the caterpillar of \"pathysa nomius\". (davidson & aitken quoted in bingham) the green pupa, is as in all swallowtails, is held by a silk girdle. said to be found mainly on the plant \"unona lawii\" and never under stones. (davidson and aitken)\\n <p> a cocoon is a casing spun of silk by many moth caterpillars, and numerous other holometabolous insect larvae as a protective covering for the pupa. most lepidoptera larvae will either make a cocoon and pupate inside them or will pupate in a cell under the ground, with the exception of butterflies and advanced moths such as noctuids, whose pupae are exposed. the pupae of moths are usually brown and smooth whereas butterfly pupae are often colourful and their shape varies greatly. in butterflies, the exposed pupa is often referred to as a chrysalis, derived from the greek term \"chrysalis\": (\"\") for gold, referring to the golden colour of some pupae.\\n <p> the caterpillar tunnels through the entire leaf in a neat winding manner so as to make sure to consume the entire leaf. it leaves a black trail within that is filled with droppings. the caterpillar can only be seen when it is changing leaves or when it comes to the surface to pupate.\\n <p> when the caterpillar is fully mature it spins a dark brown silken cocoon on a branch which usually has a leaf to protect it with. when spinning is complete, the caterpillar sheds its final skin and takes the form of its pupall life stage. within a day of spinning completion, the cocoon sets to a hard waterproof shell with a rough exterior and a smooth interior wall. air holes can be seen along the side of the cocoon indicating that the cocoon is probably otherwise airtight. the moth usually emerges from the cocoon the following year (in spring or early summer) but depending on weather conditions can stay in the cocoon from anywhere between two and five years. one case has even been recorded of a moth emerging out of the cocoon after 10 years.', 'answer': \"Here's an interesting podcast about that very thing: The upshot is that yes, they turn into goo. But also, it's been proven that memories persist through the goo stage. So somehow, something carries through the chrysalis. It seems like there may be more to memory than we currently understand.\"}]\n","[{'question': 'why is it on clear nights it is much cooler then on cloudy ones?', 'context': '<p> because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. for example, on clear nights earth\\'s surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. this is because clouds (ho) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. this is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.\\n <p> much of the winter variability in this region is due to clouds. since there is no sunlight, the thermal radiation emitted by the atmosphere is one of this region\\'s main sources of energy in winter. a cloudy sky can emit much more energy toward the surface than a clear sky, so when it is cloudy in winter, this region tends to be warm, and when it is clear, this region cools quickly.\\n <p> in winter nights, if the sky is clear, temperatures may fall below zero, usually reaching about . conversely, in summer, especially during sunny days, the temperature can easily exceed , and sometimes it reaches . furthermore, the sensation of heat in summer is increased by the high humidity.\\n <p> bullet::::- due to the thin atmosphere, the temperature difference between day and night is much larger than on earth, typically around 70\\xa0°c (125\\xa0°f). however, the day/night temperature variation is much lower during dust storms when very little light gets through to the surface even during the day, and instead warms the middle atmosphere.\\n <p> climate data have shown that the variance between daily lows and highs may have played a role in the lower average temperature because the fluctuations were much more subdued. generally, the mornings were warmer because of nightly cloud cover and the evenings were cooler because the clouds had dissipated. there were documented fluctuations of cloud cover for various locations that suggested it was a nightly occurrence and the sun killed them off, much like a fog. the class boundaries between 1810–1830 without volcanically perturbed years was around . in contrast, the volcanically perturbed years (1815–1817) had a change of only around . this meant that the mean annual cycle in 1816 was more linear than bell shaped and 1817 endured cooling across the board. southeastern england, northern france, and the netherlands experienced the greatest amount of cooling in europe, accompanied by new york, new hampshire, delaware, and rhode island in north america. (bodenmann et al. 2011)\\n <p> fog is formed when the air cools enough that the vapour pressure encourages condensation over evaporation. in order for the air to be cool on a summer night, the sky must be clear, so excess heat can be radiated into space. cloudy skies act like a blanket, absorbing and reradiating the heat, keeping it in. so if it is cool enough (and clear enough) for fog to form, it will probably be clear the next day. winter fog is the result of two entirely different circumstances. above the ocean or a large lake, air is typically more humid than above land. when the humid air moves over cold land, it will form fog and precipitation. (to the east of the north american great lakes, this is a common phenomenon, and is known as the \"lake effect.\") in northerly climates, ice fog may form when the temperature drops substantially below freezing. it is almost exclusively an urban phenomenon, when the air is so cold that any vapor pressure results in condensation, and additional vapour emitted by automobiles, household furnaces, and industrial plants simply accumulates as fog.\\n <p> temperatures are hot in summer reaching up to , and in winter are cool, either because of the fog (about twenty days from november to january ) or a cold and dry wind blowing from the northwest, the \"cierzo\" (related to other northerly winds such as the \"mistral\" in the se of france) on clear days. frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. the cierzo can cause a \\'wind chill factor\\' as low as during cold spells.', 'answer': \"Clouds act like insulation and trap heat, but it's not uncommon for temps to change day to day for other reasons...\"}]\n","[{'question': 'how is sound quality increased?', 'context': '<p> perceived quality can be influenced by listening environment (ambient noise), listener attention, and listener training and in most cases by listener audio equipment (such as sound cards, speakers and headphones). furthermore, sufficient quality may be achieved by a lesser quality setting for lectures and human speech applications and reduces encoding time and complexity. a test given to new students by stanford university music professor jonathan berger showed that student preference for mp3-quality music has risen each year. berger said the students seem to prefer the \\'sizzle\\' sounds that mp3s bring to music.\\n <p> it is difficult, but very important, to match sound levels before comparing systems, as minute increases in loudness—more than 0.15 db or 0.1\\xa0db—have been demonstrated to cause perceived improvements in sound quality.\\n <p> manufacturers usually advertise that their higher frequency systems improve audio quality and range. in the ideal case, higher frequencies actually have worse signal propagation as shown by the basic friis transmission equation, and path loss tends to increase at higher frequencies as well. practical influences on quality and range are signal strength, antenna quality, the method of modulation used, and interference, which varies locally.\\n <p> sound quality is typically an assessment of the accuracy, fidelity, or intelligibility of audio output from an electronic device. quality can be measured objectively, such as when tools are used to gauge the accuracy with which the device reproduces an original sound; or it can be measured subjectively, such as when human listeners respond to the sound or gauge its \"perceived\" similarity to another sound.\\n <p> these are effects that tend to occur only during parts of a waveform fed through audio amplifiers, that may give rise to audible degradation of the sound quality in music, even when fixed-frequency harmonic distortion tests show low amounts of distortion for a simple sinewave test signal.\\n <p> record companies, mixing engineers and mastering engineers have been gradually increasing the overall volume of commercial albums. the greater loudness is achieved by using higher degrees of compression and limiting during mixing and mastering; compression algorithms have been engineered specifically to accomplish the task of maximizing audio level in the digital stream. hard limiting or clipping can result, affecting the tone and timbre of the music. the effort to increase loudness has been referred to as the loudness war.\\n <p> also acoustic instruments may represent a risk for hearing damages, especially with lengthy exercising in rooms with high reverberation. however, the sound level and the risk have increased with more powerful amplifiers and loudspeakers, and the volume at some concerts is far above the level which may induce such damages without ear protection. 115 dba (decibel-a) at average may be risky even after 30 seconds, and a 10db increase means doubling the sound level (an angle grinder at 1 m gives about 100 dba, and in uk, norway, etc., it is strictly prohibited for workers to use it more than a few minutes without ear protection). the sound level claimed at some of manowar\\'s performances, may cause ear damages almost immediately; the phrase \"deafening sound\" should be taken literally. the control of noise at work regulations 2005 introduced safety limits for daily noise exposure in the uk like 92 dba as average during 30 minutes.', 'answer': \"Here's the analogy - a computer understands data as straight lines - a square is 4 straight lines at 90 degree angles. An octagon is 8 straight lines at 135 degree angles, etc. Sound is like a circle. In order to understand it, the computer has to turn it into a shape made of straight lines. Software encoding and bit rate determine how many lines the computer uses to make the circle shape. The more lines, the more the shape will look like a circle. From a digital standpoint, since a circle has infinite points, infinite data would be required to make a perfect representation of it, so no - we can never reach a peak in digital sound quality, but that doesn't matter, because human ears wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The other half of the problem is the speaker. The speaker has to be able to take the sound data and turn it back into a smooth curve. It has to be able to make really small curves and really large curves. It has to be able to make several curves at the same time. The more the speaker can do, the better the sound quality. There are more than two factors, but if I had to pick two, bit rate and speakers would be the ones I chose.\"}]\n","[{'question': 'what stops a rocket in space from accelerating to a really high speed when there is no air in space which could lead to drag?', 'context': '<p> drag is a force opposite to the direction of the rocket\\'s motion relative to any air it is moving through. this slows the speed of the vehicle and produces structural loads. the deceleration forces for fast-moving rockets are calculated using the drag equation.\\n <p> a related issue is drag. if the near light-speed space craft is interacting with matter or energy that is moving slowly in the planetary reference frame—solar wind, magnetic fields, cosmic microwave background radiation—this will cause drag which will bleed off a portion of the engine\\'s acceleration.\\n <p> in these equations atmospheric friction (air drag) is not taken into account. a rocket moving out of a gravity well does not actually need to attain escape velocity to escape, but could achieve the same result (escape) at any speed with a suitable mode of propulsion and sufficient propellant to provide the accelerating force on the object to escape. escape velocity is only required to send a ballistic object on a trajectory that will allow the object to escape the gravity well of the mass \"m\".\\n <p> rockets create thrust by expelling mass backward at high velocity. the thrust produced can be calculated by multiplying the mass flow rate of the propellants by their exhaust velocity relative to the rocket (specific impulse). a rocket can be thought of as being accelerated by the pressure of the combusting gases against the combustion chamber and nozzle, not by \"pushing\" against the air behind or below it. rocket engines perform best in outer space because of the lack of air pressure on the outside of the engine. in space it is also possible to fit a longer nozzle without suffering from flow separation.\\n <p> drag can be minimised by an aerodynamic nose cone and by using a shape with a high ballistic coefficient (the \"classic\" rocket shape—long and thin), and by keeping the rocket\\'s angle of attack as low as possible.\\n <p> once in orbit, their speed keeps them in orbit above the atmosphere. if e.g., an elliptical orbit dips into dense air, the object will lose speed and re-enter (i.e. fall). occasionally a space craft will intentionally intercept the atmosphere, in an act commonly referred to as an aerobraking maneuver\\n <p> during a rocket launch, as the vehicle speed increases, and the atmosphere thins, there is a point of maximum aerodynamic drag called max q. this determines the minimum aerodynamic strength of the vehicle, as the rocket must avoid buckling under these forces.', 'answer': 'Theoretically, nothing stops the rocket from accelerating. Practically, you need energy (in the form of rocket fuel, for example) to accelerate.

the candu power reactors used in canadian power plants are an example of this type. \\n <p> estimating when iran might possibly achieve nuclear \"breakout\" capability, defined as having produced a sufficient quantity of highly enriched uranium to fuel a weapon – if a working design for one existed and the political decision to assemble it was made – is uncertain. a detailed analysis by physicists at the federation of american scientists concludes that such an estimate would depend on the total number and overall efficiency of the centrifuges iran has in operation, and the amount of low-enriched uranium it has stockpiled to serve as \"feedstock\" for a possible high-enrichment program. a 23 march 2012 u.s. congressional research service report quotes 24 february 2012 iaea report saying that iran has stockpiled 240 pounds of 20-percent-enriched uranium – an enrichment level necessary for medical applications – as an indication of their capacity to enrich to higher levels. the authoritarian political culture of iran may pose additional challenges to a scientific program requiring cooperation among many technical specialists. some experts argue that the intense focus on iran\\'s nuclear program detracts from a need for broader diplomatic engagement with the islamic republic. u.s. intelligence agency officials interviewed by \"the new york times\" in march 2012 said they continued to assess that iran had not restarted its weaponization program, which the 2007 national intelligence estimate said iran had discontinued in 2003, although they have found evidence that some weaponization-related activities have continued. the israeli mossad reportedly shared this belief.\\n <p> bullet::::- iran\\'s stockpile of low-enriched uranium was reduced by 97 percent, from 10,000\\xa0kg to 300\\xa0kg. this reduction will be maintained for fifteen years. for the same fifteen-year period, iran will be limited to enriching uranium to 3.67%, a percentage sufficient for civilian nuclear power and research, but not for building a nuclear weapon. however, the number of centrifuges is sufficient for a nuclear weapon, but not for nuclear power. this is a \"major decline\" in iran\\'s previous nuclear activity; prior to watering down its stockpile pursuant to the joint plan of action interim agreement, iran had enriched uranium to near 20% (medium-enriched uranium). these enriched uranium in excess of 300\\xa0kg of up to 3.67% will be down blended to natural uranium level or be sold in return for natural uranium, and the uranium enriched to between 5% and 20% will be fabricated into fuel plates for the tehran research reactor or sold or diluted to an enrichment level of 3.67%. the implementation of the commercial contracts will be facilitated by p5+1. after fifteen years, all physical limits on enrichment will be removed, including limits on the type and number of centrifuges, iran\\'s stockpile of enriched uranium, and where iran may have enrichment facilities. according to belfer, at this point iran could \"expand its nuclear program to create more practical overt and covert nuclear weapons options\".\\n <p> in february 2010, to refuel the tehran research reactor which produces medical isotopes, iran began using a single cascade to enrich uranium \"up to 19.8%\", to match the previously foreign supplied fuel. 20% is the upper threshold for low enriched uranium (leu). though heu enriched to levels exceeding 20% is considered technically usable in a nuclear explosive device, this route is much less desirable because far more material is required to achieve a sustained nuclear chain reaction. heu enriched to 90% and above is most typically used in a weapons development program.\\n <p> colin kahl, former deputy assistant u.s. secretary of defense for the middle east, estimated in may 2014 that iran\\'s stockpile was large enough to build 6 nuclear weapons and it had to be reduced. constraints on iran\\'s uranium enrichment would reduce the chance that its nuclear program could be used to make nuclear warheads. the number and quality of centrifuges, research and development of advanced centrifuges, and the size of low-enriched uranium stockpiles, would be relevant. the constraints were interrelated with each other, that the more centrifuges iran had, the smaller the stockpile the united states and p5+1 should accept, and vice versa. lengthening breakout timelines required a substantial reduction in enrichment capacity, and many experts talk about an acceptable range of about 2000-6000 first-generation centrifuges. iran stated that it wanted to extend its capability substantially. in may 2014 robert j. einhorn, former special advisor on non-proliferation and arms control at the u.s. department of state, claimed that if iran was to continue to insist on what he considered to be a huge number of centrifuges, then there would be no agreement, since this enrichment capacity would bring the breakout time down to weeks or days.\\n <p> most bwr and pwr commercial reactors use uranium enriched to about 4% u-235, and some commercial reactors with a high neutron economy do not require the fuel to be enriched at all (that is, they can use natural uranium). according to the international atomic energy agency there are at least 100 research reactors in the world fueled by highly enriched (weapons-grade/90% enrichment) uranium. theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).\\n <p> heavy water reactors and graphite-moderated reactors can use natural uranium, but the vast majority of the world\\'s reactors require enriched uranium, in which the ratio of u-235 to u-238 is increased. in civilian reactors, the enrichment is increased to 3-5% u-235 and 95% u-238, but in naval reactors there is as much as 93% u-235.', 'answer': \"Honestly, there's nothing really stopping the iranians from *trying* to make weapons grade uranium.

AV usually have options to dial the heuristics up or down since more stringent heuristics detection means more hits means better protection means more false positives. 3. sometimes an AV will just let an unknown software actually run in an isolated sandbox then watch what it does to see if it does anything bad. 4. if you *really* want to be secure, you can use a whitelist system, where you only allow anything in your database. anything unknown gets blocked. this would be a huge PITA to use and is exceedingly rare, and it's not really traditionally part of an AV either.\"}]\n","[{'question': 'how come your hearing is better when you have been in silence for a while?', 'context': '<p> bullet::::- severe hearing loss - people with severe hearing loss depend on powerful hearing aid. however, they often rely on lip-reading even when they are using hearing aids. the most quiet sounds heard by people with severe hearing loss with their better ear are between 70 and 95\\xa0db hl.\\n <p> bullet::::- mild hearing loss - people with mild hearing loss have difficulties keeping up with conversations, especially in noisy surroundings. the most quiet sounds that people with mild hearing loss can hear with their better ear are between 25 and 40\\xa0db hl.\\n <p> bullet::::- moderate hearing loss - people with moderate hearing loss have difficulty keeping up with conversations when they are not using a hearing aid. on average, the most quiet sounds heard by people with moderate hearing loss with their better ear are between 40 and 70\\xa0db hl.\\n <p> hearing may deteriorate gradually from chronic and repeated noise exposure (such as to loud music or background noise) or suddenly from exposure to impulse noise, which is a short high intensity noise (such as a gunshot or airhorn). in both types, loud sound overstimulates delicate hearing cells, leading to the permanent injury or death of the cells. once lost this way, hearing cannot be restored in humans.\\n <p> bullet::::- profound hearing loss - people with profound hearing loss are very hard of hearing and they mostly rely on lip-reading and sign language. the most quiet sounds heard by people with profound hearing loss with their better ear are from 95\\xa0db hl or more.\\n <p> for a person with a sensorineural hearing loss (snhl) in quiet, the srt also needs to be higher than for a person with normal hearing. this is because the only factor that is important in quiet for a chl and a snhl is the audibility of the sound, which corresponds to factor a. in noise, the person with a snhl requires a better signal-to-noise ratio to achieve the same performance level, as the person with normal hearing and the person with a chl. this shows that in noise, factor a is not enough to explain the problems of a person with a snhl. therefore, there is another problem present, which is factor d. at present, it is not known what causes factor d. thus, in noise the audiogram is irrelevant. it is the type of hearing loss that is important in this situation.\\n <p> one reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the head shadow effect. newborn children with no hearing on one side but one normal ear could still have problems. speech development could be delayed and difficulties to concentrate in school are common. more children with unilateral hearing loss have to repeat classes than their peers. taking part in social activities could be a problem. early aiding is therefore of utmost importance.', 'answer': \"Your hearing isn't better, so much as your concious mind is focuses much more on individual sounds. Our brains naturally tune out a lot of stimuli, especially if it's repetitive, to minimize neural load and energy usage. Being in a silent space for awhile causes our brains to focus much more on sound in order to listen for ANYTHING that might hurt us. Once you reenter a loud area, much of our brains focus is on sound input.

By moving the faders for the various inputs on its controls, all you're doing is opening and closing electrical connections to the mixer's various outputs. The EQ controls (e.g. high, mid, low) route the signal through various transistors, resistors and capacitors that have the corresponding effects on the signal. Think of it as guiding an audio signal through a maze, telling it which turns to take and which exit to leave from. A powered mixer also acts as amplifier, while a standard mixer must be connected to a separate amplifier. edit: Accidentally a word.\"}]\n","[{'question': 'what would happen to the earth if all the whales were gone?', 'context': '<p> although the whales no longer face pressure from commercial whaling, mankind remains by far the greatest threat to these species: the two leading causes of death are being struck by ships and entanglement in fishing gear. ingestion of plastic marine debris also presents a growing threat. for the north atlantic right whale, for example, whose population was estimated at 411 in 2018 which was down from 451 in 2016 and 458 in 2015, these two anthropogenic factors alone account for 48% of all known right whale deaths since 1970. more than 85% of right whales have been entangled at least once.\\n <p> so called because they were the ‘right’ whale to kill, southern right whales were brought to the verge of extinction during the early 20th century. their enormous blubber reserves caused the animals to float after being killed, whilst their slow-moving nature made them easy targets. whilst significant conservation threats still remain (primarily habitat loss), many populations have shown slow signs of recovery. the long-term objective of the patagonian right whale program is to promote and facilitate this recovery.\\n <p> most of the deaths of the whales have occurred at the coast of the western region of ghana and raised fears that it was the oil drilling that is responsible for the deaths. since the discovery of oil in 2007 some environmentalists are skeptical whether oil and gas will be handled judiciously to avoid environmental degradation. decomposed whale carcasses have been washing onto beaches in western region making environmental groups worried the country\\'s growing petroleum industry may be killing marine life. local people count a total of 20 dead whales discovered along ghana\\'s coastline in the last four years, including at least eight since september 2013. whales are mammals and what kills them is still unresolved.\\n <p> once relentlessly hunted for their products, whales are now protected by international law. the north atlantic right whales nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and the north pacific grey whale population is ranked critically endangered by the iucn. besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. the meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the arctic. whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide, notably by the inuit and the coastal peoples of vietnam and ghana, who sometimes hold whale funerals. whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of herman melville\\'s \"moby dick\". small whales, such as belugas, are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor and the animals often die within a few months of capture. whale watching has become a form of tourism around the world.\\n <p> whaling and other threats have led to at least five of the 13 great whales being listed as endangered. a past ban which was implemented around the 1960s has helped some of these species of whale to recover. according to iucn\\'s cetacean specialist group (csg), \"several populations of southern right whales, humpbacks in many areas, grey whales in the eastern north pacific, and blue whales in both the eastern north pacific and central north atlantic have begun to show signs of recovery.\" populations of many other whales species are also increasing.\\n <p> in november 2018, over 140 whales were witnessed stranded on a remote beach in new zealand and had to be euthanised because of their declining health condition. in july 2019, nearly 50 long-finned pilot whales were found stranded on snaefellsnes peninsula in iceland. however, they were already dead when spotted. \\n <p> at present, they are among the most endangered whales in the world, and they are protected under the u.s. endangered species act and marine mammal protection act and canada\\'s species at risk act. there are about 400 individuals in existence in the western north atlantic ocean—they migrate between feeding grounds in the labrador sea and their winter calving areas off georgia and florida, an ocean area with heavy shipping traffic. in the eastern north atlantic, on the other hand—with a total population reaching into the low teens at most—scientists believe that they may already be functionally extinct. vessel strikes and entanglement in fixed fishing gear, which together account for nearly half of all north atlantic right whale mortality since 1970, are their two greatest threats to recovery.', 'answer': 'ELI5 does not allow hypotheticals.

Small particles have a larger ratio of surface area to volume than larger particles. If we consider each grain as a sphere, the surface area is A = 4 pi r^2 And the volume is 4/3 pi r^3 This means that the ratio of area to volume is A/V = 3/r This means that the larger the radius, the more mass you have compared to the surface area. The attractive force given per unit surface area is the same regardless of particle size, and so is the density. This means that the attractive force per unit mass is roughly given by F/m = k/r, Where k is some constant factor. The force of gravity is F = mg And so, the grain of sand will \"stick\" if the attractive force is greater than gravity, so k/r > g So, in order to reach this threshold you *must* decrease the radius below a critical point. Water has a higher affinity for SiO2 than your feet do, but the general math still works out.

4), so the odds against drawing a royal flush are 2,598,956 : 4, or 649,739 : 1. the formula for establishing the odds can also be stated as \"(1/p) - 1 : 1\", where \"p\" is the aforementioned probability.\\n <p> in gambling, odds represent the ratio between the amounts staked by parties to a wager or bet. thus, odds of 5 to 1 mean the first party (normally a bookmaker) stakes six times the amount staked by the second party. in simplest terms, 5 to 1 odds means if you bet a dollar (the \"1\" in the expression), and you win you get paid five dollars (the \"5\" in the expression), or 5 times 1. if you bet two dollars you would be paid ten dollars, or 5 times 2. if you bet three dollars and win, you would be paid fifteen dollars, or 5 times 3. if you bet one hundred dollars and win you would be paid five hundred dollars, or 5 times 100. if you lose any of those bets you would lose the dollar, or two dollars, or three dollars, or one hundred dollars.\\n <p> the gambling and statistical uses of odds are closely interlinked. if a bet is a fair one, then the odds offered to the gamblers will perfectly reflect relative probabilities. a fair bet that a fair die will roll a three will pay the gambler $5 for a $1 wager (and return the bettor his or her wager) in the case of a three and nothing in any other case. the terms of the bet are fair, because on average, five rolls result in something other than a three, at a cost of $5, for every roll that results in a three and a net payout of $5. the profit and the expense exactly offset one another and so there is no advantage to gambling over the long run. if the odds being offered to the gamblers do not correspond to probability in this way then one of the parties to the bet has an advantage over the other. casinos, for example, offer odds that place themselves at an advantage, which is how they guarantee themselves a profit and survive as businesses. the fairness of a particular gamble is more clear in a game involving relatively pure chance, such as the ping-pong ball method used in state lotteries in the united states. it is much harder to judge the fairness of the odds offered in a wager on a sporting event such as a football match.\\n <p> the numerator and denominator of fractional odds are always integers, thus if the bookmaker\\'s payout was to be £1.25 for every £1 stake, this would be equivalent to £5 for every £4 staked, and the odds would therefore be expressed as 5/4. however, not all fractional odds are traditionally read using the lowest common denominator. for example, given that there is a pattern of odds of 5/4, 7/4, 9/4 and so on, odds which are mathematically 3/2 are more easily compared if expressed in the equivalent form 6/4.\\n <p> in gambling, the odds on display do not represent the true chances (as imagined by the bookmaker) that the event will or will not occur, but are the amount that the bookmaker will pay out on a winning bet, together with the required stake. in formulating the odds to display the bookmaker will have included a profit margin which effectively means that the payout to a successful bettor is less than that represented by the true chance of the event occurring. this profit is known as the \\'over-round\\' on the \\'book\\' (the \\'book\\' refers to the old-fashioned ledger in which wagers were recorded, and is the derivation of the term \\'bookmaker\\') and relates to the sum of the \\'odds\\' in the following way:\\n <p> odds are a numerical expression, usually expressed as a pair of numbers, used in both gambling and statistics. in statistics, the odds for or odds of some event reflect the likelihood that the event will take place, while odds against reflect the likelihood that it will not. in gambling, the odds are the ratio of payoff to stake, and do not necessarily reflect exactly the probabilities. odds are expressed in several ways (see below), and sometimes the term is used incorrectly to mean simply the probability of an event. conventionally, gambling odds are expressed in the form \"x to y\", where x and y are numbers, and it is implied that the odds are odds against the event on which the gambler is considering wagering. in both gambling and statistics, the \\'odds\\' are a numerical expression of the likelihood of some possible event.\\n <p> the odds quoted for a particular event may be fixed but are more likely to fluctuate in order to take account of the size of wagers placed by the bettors in the run-up to the actual event (e.g. a horse race). this article explains the mathematics of making a book in the (simpler) case of the former event. for the second method, see parimutuel betting.', 'answer': \"Comparative purposes. Fractional betting odds (as opposed to decimals or moneyline) commonly use a single denominator which isn't the lowest, but is consistent across a table. Say there's 4 horses in a race, you might see a spread of odds like this : 4/6, 4/2, 4/12, 4/3 Sure, you could write it as: 2/3, 2/1, 1/3, 4/3, but that would make it harder to judge the odds in comparison to others. It only stays higher when the comparison is relevant, like comparing multiple competitors (racing, for instance). When betting on a single event (like boxing), it's reduced to the lowest common denominator.\"}]\n","[{'question': 'why the uk never made their overseas islands integral part of their country?', 'context': '<p> the british overseas territories (bots) or united kingdom overseas territories (ukots) are 14 territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the united kingdom. they are remnants of the british empire that have not been granted independence or have voted to remain british territories. these territories do not form part of the united kingdom and, with the exception of gibraltar, are not part of the european union. most of the permanently inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the uk retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. three are inhabited only by a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. they all share the british monarch (elizabeth ii) as head of state.\\n <p> britain retains sovereignty over 14 territories outside the british isles. in 1983, the british nationality act 1981 renamed the existing crown colonies as \"british dependent territories\", and in 2002 they were renamed the british overseas territories. three are uninhabited except for transient military or scientific personnel; the remaining eleven are self-governing to varying degrees and are reliant on the uk for foreign relations and defence. the british government has stated its willingness to assist any overseas territory that wishes to proceed to independence, where that is an option, and three territories have specifically voted to remain under british sovereignty (bermuda in 1995, gibraltar in 2002 and the falkland islands in 2013).\\n <p> the united kingdom has 14 british overseas territories scattered around the world. unlike some former colonial powers, the british government does not classify its overseas possessions (or the crown dependencies, which share historical ties with the british crown) as subdivisions of the united kingdom itself; rather, each is treated in law as a separate jurisdiction. most have their own legislatures and a degree of autonomy usually exceeding that of the devolved uk nations, including fiscal independence. \\n <p> the united kingdom also retains territories in the form of saint helena, ascension, and tristan da cunha off africa\\'s western seaboard in the atlantic ocean, as does portugal with the islands of madeira north of the canary islands and italy with the islands of lampedusa and lampione off the northern coast of tunisia.\\n <p> the british overseas territories (bot) or alternatively, united kingdom overseas territories (ukots), are 14 territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the united kingdom. they are the parts of the british empire that have not been granted independence or have voted to remain british territories. these territories do not form part of the united kingdom and, with the exception of gibraltar, are not part of the european union. most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the uk retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. the rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel.\\n <p> the islands do not form part of the european union and instead constitute \"overseas countries and territories\" (oct status) of the union, to which special provisions apply. the lisbon treaty introduced a procedure where the european council may change the status of an overseas territory of denmark, france, or the netherlands regarding the application of the eu treaties to that territory. in june 2008, the dutch government published a survey of the legal and economic impacts by a switched status from oct to outermost region (omr). the position of the islands was reviewed after a five-year transitional period, which began with the dissolution of the netherlands antilles in october 2010. the review was conducted as part of the planned review of the dutch \"act for the public bodies bonaire, sint eustatius and saba\" (), where the islands have been granted the option to become an omr – and thus a direct part of the european union. in october 2015, the review concluded the present legal structures for governance and integration with european netherlands was not working well within the framework of wolbes, but no recommendations were made in regards of whether a switch from oct to omr status would help improve this situation.\\n <p> almost all of the british overseas territories are islands (or groups of islands) with a small population; some are in very remote areas of the world. of the territories with a permanent population, all have at least some degree of internal self-government, with the united kingdom retaining responsibility for defence and external relations.', 'answer': 'In this case France is the odd man out.

practica, which gave astrological predictions for the year ahead; and diaries for personal and professional use. the introduction of broadside printing allowed a calendar to be printed on a single large sheet of paper, differentiating the basic calendar from more detailed diaries and practica. in the absence of accurate clocks, calendars doubled as timekeeping aids - by noting the times of sunrise and moonrise, calendars helped farmers tell the time while in the fields.\\n <p> from the limited information available, the start-date, end-date, and number of editions produced are unknown; as are the quantities printed. the one example found online is the edition of october–november-december 1918, produced in january 1919. the gazette was published in french, book-style, in a 2-column format; with professional newspaper-quality printing in black ink, on what looks like unfinished (i.e.: no coating, glossy or satin) paper of a fairly heavy grade of slightly rough newsprint. this volume has about 41 printed pages, with some blanks at the end. aside from the cover illustration (drawing) and some minor decorations around the text on a few pages, and 1 page (single-side, on glossy paper) of black & white photographs, the rest of the material is entirely in text-form. it includes a notice-page of deaths, promotions, etc. of students/alumni serving in the military; articles about the war; news of the school; news & information of interest to art-professionals; and some pieces relating to student-politics. the general tone is patriotic, and generally uncritical of the war as conducted by the french government. there is no inclusion of pacifist material, and only limited representation of leftist views;

Using all of that sugar for energy can be great, but it isn\\'t the only way the body can get energy. Your body can also get energy from fat. Instead of turning fat into glucose, though, your body turns it into \"ketone bodies.\" When your body is burning ketone bodies instead of glucose, you are on a \"ketogenic diet,\" or \"in ketosis.\" The way the diet works isn\\'t entirely understood, because it\\'s part of a very complicated digestive process with many different chemicals (\\'hormones\") all interacting in different ways, and it can be hard to study. The basic theory, though, is that when a body is \"in ketosis\" it like burning through fat, so if you don\\'t feed yourself quite enough fat to meet your body\\'s demand it will burn your body fat, too. All diets work (or are supposed to work) by making your body turn to its stored fat for energy; \"keto\" is thought by some people to be a more efficient means of doing this. Other people think \"keto\" works simply by making you feel more full (fat and protein often make you feel more full than carbs, and being in ketosis might help this feeling happen sooner, too, again for complicated reasons) and thus helping you eat less. This is another part of the diet that still isn\\'t entirely understood, though more and more research is being done all the time. The basic eating plan for a keto diet is simple: eat fewer than 20g of non-fiber carbs per day (the amount of carbs you can eat actually varies from person to person for a variety of complex reasons, but 20g per day is a good target for most people; fiber is counted as carbs on nutritional labels but your body can\\'t actually digest it, so they don\\'t count towards your limit on keto). That really is all there is to it. Of course, there\\'s a lot more you should pay attention to if you want to do keto in a healthy manner. Eating plenty of vegetables (vegetables should be your primary source of carbs), eating fat to replace the energy you\\'re used to getting from carbs, and eating protein to protect your lean body mass (making sure your muscles don\\'t get eaten up) are all important recommendations.

'context': '<p> congressional redistricting occurs every 10 years as congressional boundaries are redrawn after the census. under article one of the constitution, the state legislature controls this process. in order to prevent gerrymandering, the proposed legislation would require states to use independent commissions to design their congressional districts. if they declined to do so, the federal government would set one up for them.\\n <p> all redistricting in the united states has been contentious because it has been controlled by political parties vying for power. as a consequence of the decennial census required by the united states constitution, districts for members of the house of representatives typically need to be redrawn whenever the number of members in a state changes. in many states, state legislatures redraw boundaries for state legislative districts at the same time.\\n <p> in the united states, the number of representatives within the house of representatives that serve a state is based on the results of the united states census, run every ten years. this leads to redistricting, changes in the boundaries of the state\\'s district. redistricting is typically done by representatives of the political party in power within the state, and can result in the practice of gerrymandering, creating oddly-shaped districts that help to favor the party\\'s chances for election due to the population distribution within them. the supreme court has ruled that gerrymandering based on racial and ethnic grounds is unconstitutional, and had stated that partisan gerrymandering is also likely unconstitutional, but has yet to develop a valid means to determine when partisan gerrymandering has occurred.\\n <p> the redistricting of united states congressional districts is made by the legislatures of the states every 10 years, immediately following the official announcement of the federal census that serves as the basis of the apportionment. it was long the practice that the apportionment thus made stood until after the next decennial census.\\n <p> unlike most states, which will pass or have passed redistricting laws to redraw the boundaries of their congressional districts based on the 2010 united states census in advance of the 2012 elections, maine law requires that redistricting be done in 2013. in march 2011, a lawsuit was filed asking a u.s. district judge to ensure redistricting is completed in time for the 2012 elections. according to the census, the 1st district had a population of 8,669 greater than that of the 2nd district. the maine democratic party, which opposes the lawsuit, was granted intervenor status, and argues that the lawsuit constitutes an attempt by the maine republican party to force representatives chellie pingree and mike michaud, both of whom are democrats, to run in the same district. on june 9, 2011, a panel of three federal judges agreed that failing to redistrict would be unconstitutional, and that the state should redraw the boundaries of its districts immediately.\\n <p> each u.s. representative represents one congressional district, which encompasses all or part of a single state. the states have wide latitude in the re-drawing of congressional districts, a process known as redistricting. state power over redistricting is subject to limits set by the u.s. constitution, rulings of the federal judiciary and statutes passed by congress. in the case of \"wesberry v. sanders,\" the supreme court of the united states established that states must draw districts that are equal in population \"as nearly as is practicable.\" subsequent court cases have required states to redistrict every ten years, although states can redistrict more often than that depending on their own statutes and constitutional provisions. since the passage of the 1967 uniform congressional districts act, most states have been barred from using multi-member districts; all states currently use single-member districts. the voting rights act of 1965 establishes protections against racial redistricting plans that would deny minority voters an equal opportunity to elect representatives of their choice. the supreme court case of \"thornburg v. gingles\" established a test to determine whether redistricting lines violate the voting rights act. in some states, courts have required the creation of majority-minority districts. many states have also adopted other criteria, including compactness, contiguity, and the preservation of political subdivisions (such as cities or counties) or communities of interest. some states, including arizona, require the drawing of competitive districts.\\n <p> the apportionment of congressional districts is not dependent upon a specially-mandated independent government body, but rather through republic acts which are drafted by members of congress. therefore, apportionment often can be influenced by political motivations. incumbent representatives who are not permitted by law to serve after three consecutive terms sometimes resort to dividing their district, or even creating a new province which will be guaranteed a seat, just so that their allies be able to run, while \"switching offices\" with them. likewise, politicians whose political fortunes are likely to be jeopardized by any change in district boundaries may delay or even ignore the need for reapportionment.', 'answer': 'Gerrymandering always occurs. Due to the perceived issues associated with gerrymandering and its impact on competitive elections and democratic accountability, numerous countries have enacted reforms making the practice either more difficult or less effective. Countries such as the U.K., Australia, Canada and most of those in Europe have transferred responsibility for defining constituency boundaries to neutral or cross-party bodies. In the United States, however, such reforms are controversial and frequently meet particularly strong opposition from groups that benefit from gerrymandering. In a more neutral system, they might lose considerable influence. To defeat gerrymandering a bipartisan movement towards fairness would have to push for reform. Incumbents would have to vote for change. But they want to retain power and do not want a fair system.'}]\n","[{'question': 'if a human was born, raised, and lived in space their entire life, how would zero gravity effect their skin, organs, bones, and body?', 'context': '<p> artificial gravity has been suggested as a solution to the various health risks associated with spaceflight. in 1964, the soviet space program believed that a human could not survive more than 14 days in space due to a fear that the heart and blood vessels would be unable to adapt to the weightless conditions. this fear was eventually discovered to be unfounded as spaceflights have now lasted up to 438 consecutive days, with missions aboard the international space station commonly lasting 6 months. however, the question of human safety in space did launch an investigation into the physical effects of prolonged exposure to weightlessness. in june 1991, a spacelab life sciences 1 flight performed 18 experiments on two men and two women over a period of nine days. in an environment without gravity, it was concluded that the response of white blood cells and muscle mass decreased. additionally, within the first 24 hours spent in a weightless environment, blood volume decreased by 10%. upon return to earth, the effects of prolonged weightlessness continue to affect the human body as fluids pool back to the lower body, the heart rate rises, a drop in blood pressure occurs and there is a reduced ability to exercise.\\n <p> being in space can be physiologically deconditioning on the body. it can affect the otolith organs and adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system. zero gravity and cosmic rays can cause many implications for astronauts.\\n <p> humans evolved for life in earth gravity, and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health. initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. this can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. the duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. these effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.\\n <p> humans have long lived in a 1-g environment and have therefore become accustomed to earth\\'s standard atmospheric conditions, and the microgravity environment of space can have huge effects on the human body and its locomotion (\"main article: space medicine\").\\n <p> the difference in gravity would negatively affect human health by weakening bones and muscles. there is also risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular problems. current rotations on the international space station put astronauts in zero gravity for six months, a comparable length of time to a one-way trip to mars. this gives researchers the ability to better understand the physical state that astronauts going to mars would arrive in. once on mars, surface gravity is only 38% of that on earth. upon return to earth, recovery from bone loss and atrophy is a long process and the effects of microgravity may never fully reverse.\\n <p> bullet::::- some microbes can survive gravity more than 400,000 times that felt on earth, a new study says. by contrast, most humans can tolerate three to five times earth\\'s surface gravity before losing consciousness.

in summer the colour is reddish-brown, while in winter, it turns dark brown, with males tending to be darker than the females. the tail is short in length and the rump has no distinct patch. despite these features, they are actually related to the père david\\'s deer. the antlers, bow- or lyre-shaped, do not grow upwards, but tend to grow outwards and then inwards; a smaller branch grows towards the front of the head. the brow tines are especially long and noticeable. the brow-antlered deer is so named because they have long brow tines. they shed their antlers every year, with the largest size attained during the breeding season.\\n <p> adult male thorold\\'s deer have antlers, measuring up to in beam length, and weighing up to . compared with those of wapiti or red deer, the antlers are flattened with the first and second (\"bez\") tines noticeably far apart. the antlers can have up to seven tines, which all lie in the same plane. they are shed annually in march, reaching their full length by late summer. other distinctive features include longer ears than most other deer, lined with white hair, and large metatarsal and preorbital glands. the hooves are broad and heavy, with unusually long dewclaws. the tail is short, at in length.', 'answer': 'They grow like normal bone, and are covered by \"velvet\" until they rub it off to expose the bone.

(2002) argued that the ability of a cat species to purr is not affected by the anatomy of its hyoid, i.e. whether it is fully ossified or has a ligamentous epihyoid, and that, based on a technical acoustic definition of roaring, the presence of this vocalization type depends on specific characteristics of the vocal folds and an elongated vocal tract, the latter rendered possible by an incompletely ossified hyoid. cats may purr for a variety of reasons, including when they\\'re hungry, happy, or anxious.\\n <p> the tiger, lion, leopard, and jaguar are the only cat species with the anatomical structure that enables them to roar. the primary reason for this was formerly assumed to be the incomplete ossification of the hyoid bone. however, new studies show the ability to roar is due to other morphological features, especially of the larynx. the snow leopard does not roar. although its hyoid bone is incompletely ossified, it lacks the special morphology of the larynx.\\n <p> the reason that cats are seen as \"yōkai\" in japanese mythology is attributed to many of the characteristics that they possess: for example, the way the irises of their eyes change shape depending on the time of day, the way their fur seems to cause sparks due to static electricity when they are petted (especially in winter), the way they sometimes lick blood, the way they can walk without making a sound, their wild nature that remains despite the gentleness they can show at times, the way they are difficult to control (unlike dogs), the sharpness of their claws and teeth, their nocturnal habits, and their speed and agility.\\n <p> the cougar is on average larger than all felid species apart from the lion, tiger, and jaguar. despite its size, it is not typically classified among the \"big cats\" because it cannot roar, lacking the specialized larynx and hyoid apparatus of \"panthera\". compared to \"big cats\", cougars are often silent with minimal communication through vocalizations outside of the mother-offspring relationship. cougars sometimes voice low-pitched hisses, growls, and purrs, as well as chirps and whistles, many of which are comparable to those of domestic cats. they are well known for their screams, as referenced in some of their common names, although these screams are often misinterpreted to be the calls of other animals or humans.', 'answer': \"Why should cats roar like lions? Cats and lions are related, but that doesn't mean they have the same habits. They're not the same species -- you might as well ask why humans don't live in trees, like apes do. Physically, a domestic cat wouldn't be able to roar like a lion: simply put, their vocal tracts are way too small. It would be like expecting your phone to generate the amount of bass you'd get from standing near the speakers at a concert. Adult cats don't normally meow, except domestic cats in the presence of humans. Cats do, however, growl when threatened; and when male cats confront each other in a territorial dispute, they produce a loud wailing noise, normally with their mouths closed.

of capitalism are accusations that capitalism is inherently exploitative, that it is unsustainable, that it creates economic inequality, that it is anti-democratic and leads to an erosion of human rights and that it incentivizes imperialist expansion and war.\\n <p> critics argue that capitalism is associated with the unfair distribution of wealth and power; a tendency toward market monopoly or oligopoly (and government by oligarchy); imperialism, counter-revolutionary wars and various forms of economic and cultural exploitation; repression of workers and trade unionists and phenomena such as social alienation, economic inequality, unemployment and economic instability. critics have argued that there is an inherent tendency toward oligopolistic structures when \"laissez-faire\" is combined with capitalist private property. capitalism is regarded by many socialists to be irrational in that production and the direction of the economy are unplanned, creating many inconsistencies and internal contradictions and thus should be controlled through public policy.\\n <p> criticism of capitalism comes from various political and philosophical approaches, including anarchist, socialist, religious and nationalist viewpoints. some believe that capitalism can only be overcome through revolution, and some believe that structural change can come slowly through political reforms. some critics believe there are merits in capitalism and wish to balance it with some form of social control, typically through government regulation (e.g. the social market movement).\\n <p> critics argue that capitalism leads to a significant loss of political, democratic and economic power for the vast majority of the global human population. the reason for this is they believe capitalism creates very large concentrations of money and property in the hands of a relatively small minority of the global human population (the elite or the power elite), leading, they say, to very large and increasing, wealth and income inequalities between the elite and the majority of the population. \"corporate capitalism\" and \"inverted totalitarianism\" are terms used by the aforementioned activists and critics of capitalism to describe a capitalist marketplace—and society—characterized by the dominance of hierarchical, bureaucratic, large corporations, which are legally required to pursue profit without concern for social welfare. corporate capitalism has been criticized for the amount of power and influence corporations and large business interest groups have over government policy, including the policies of regulatory agencies and influencing political campaigns. many social scientists have criticized corporations for failing to act in the interests of the people; they claim the existence of large corporations seems to circumvent the principles of democracy, which assumes equal power relations between all individuals in a society. as part of the political left, activists against corporate power and influence work towards a decreased income gap and improved economical equity.\\n <p> people hate capitalism; its successes do not impress the “poets and philosophers and priests”(p31) “the more it succeeds, the more it fails.”(p32) intellectuals indict capitalism for all kinds of sins: affluence, moral weakness, and vulgar taste. the intellectuals that do defend capitalism have not made a broad enough case.\\n <p> proponents of capitalism argue that it creates more prosperity than any other economic system and that its benefits are mainly to the ordinary person. critics of capitalism variously associate it with economic instability, an inability to provide for the well-being of all people and an unsustainable danger to the natural environment. socialists maintain that although capitalism is superior to all previously existing economic systems (such as feudalism or slavery), the contradiction between class interests will only be resolved by advancing into a completely new social system of production and distribution in which all persons have an equal relationship to the means of production.\\n <p> anti-capitalists assert that capitalism is violent. they believe private property and profit survive only because police violence defends them and that capitalist economies need war to expand. they may use the term \"structural violence\" to describe the systematic ways in which a given social structure or institution kills people slowly by preventing them from meeting their basic needs, for example the deaths caused by diseases because of lack of medicine.', 'answer': \"The main arguments I've seen against capitalism are as follows: 1) Unchecked, it will create a divided society in which a small number of

the best of the prequel trilogy, with a few even calling it the best of the entire \"star wars\" saga. a. o. scott of \"the new york times\" concluded that it was \"the best of the four episodes mr. lucas has directed\", and equal to \"the empire strikes back\" as \"the richest and most challenging movie in the cycle\". in a 2007 summary of the on rotten tomatoes, \"revenge of the sith\" was placed 51 out of 100, making it the only \"star wars\" prequel film to earn a rank on that list. jonathan rosenbaum, a critic who disliked \"a new hope\" and \"the empire strikes back\", gave the film a positive review, saying that it had a \"relatively thoughtful story\". roger ebert of the \"chicago sun-times\" gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing \"if [lucas] got bogged down in solemnity and theory in \"episode ii: attack of the clones\", the force is in a jollier mood this time, and \"revenge of the sith\" is a great entertainment.\"\\n <p> regarding the return and expansion of the franchise, lawrence kasdan noted that the spin-offs were expanding the franchise into more of a shared universe beyond the previously linear saga, adding that one of the strengths of the franchise was how it all fell under the same continuity in comparison to other franchises. kasdan also contrasted \"star wars\" to the marvel cinematic universe, noting that \"star wars\" features less comedy than the latter, and adding that he felt a more comedic approach would \"not be \"star wars\"\" to him.\\n <p> the original \"star wars\" trilogy is considered one of the best film trilogies in history. lucas has often stated that the entire trilogy was intended to be considered one film. however, he said that his story material for \"star wars\" was too long for a single film, prompting lucas to split the story into multiple films. numerous filmmakers have been influenced by \"star wars\", including damon lindelof, dean devlin, roland emmerich, john lasseter, david fincher, joss whedon, john singleton, and kevin smith, and would-be \"star wars\" directors j.\\xa0j. abrams and gareth edwards. lucas\\'s concept of a \"used future\" particularly influenced ridley scott\\'s \"blade runner\" (1982) and \"alien\" (1979), james cameron\\'s \"aliens\" (1986) as well as \"the terminator\" (1984), peter jackson\\'s \"the lord of the rings\" trilogy, and george miller\\'s \"mad max 2\". christopher nolan cited \"star wars\" as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film, \"inception\".\\n <p> with the release of the three \"star wars\" prequel films starting in 1999, and a copious amount of expanded universe material, some of the stated information about minor characters of the original trilogy became inaccurate and as such necessitated a retconned explanation. for example, boba fett\\'s backstory was explained as a \"smoke screen\" planted by fett himself to hide his father jango fett\\'s involvement in the clone wars.\\n <p> the prequel trilogy films often refer to the original trilogy in order to help connect the films together. lucas has often referred to the films as a long poem that rhymes. such examples include the line \"i have a bad feeling about this\", a phrase used in each film, and lightsaber duels which almost always occur over a pit. as with \"attack of the clones\", \"the empire strikes back\" was the middle film in a trilogy, and of the original trilogy films, \"the empire strikes back\" is the object of the most references in \"attack of the clones\". in both films, an asteroid field is the backdrop of a major star battle in the middle of the film. obi-wan escapes jango fett by attaching his spacecraft to an asteroid in order to disappear from the enemy sensors; han solo uses a similar tactic by attaching the \"millennium falcon\" to a star destroyer in \"the empire strikes back\". as a retcon, john knoll confirms on the film\\'s dvd commentary that boba fett, who would later catch solo in the act in \"the empire strikes back\", \"learned his lesson\" from the events of \"attack of the clones\".', 'answer': \"Because they simply were inferior when compared to the original trilogy. This doesn't mean that they were bad movies (even though I think that they were). It just means that they didn't live up to the quality of film that the original trilogy had.\"}]\n","[{'question': 'given the stresses on our oceans and forests, does our biosphere currently produce a surplus of oxygen or are we running at a deficit? could we run out of oxygen in the future?', 'context': \"<p> in nature, free oxygen is produced by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. according to some estimates, green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on earth, and the rest is produced by terrestrial plants. other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.\\n <p> one study in 2009 found that the fraction of fossil-fuel emissions absorbed by the oceans may have declined by up to 10% since 2000, indicating oceanic sequestration may be sublinear. another 2009 study found that the fraction of absorbed by terrestrial ecosystems and the oceans has not changed since 1850, indicating undiminished capacity.\\n <p> over the last 100 years the earth's temperature has increased 0.6 degrees celsius and it is predicted to increase an additional 3.5 degrees over the next century. tropical wet forests account for only 6% of earth's land surface yet are responsible for 40% of earth’s oxygen production. any type of change to this system can prove to have significant detrimental effects in terms of global oxygen availability. in addition, due to the sensitivity and fragile interactions between organisms and the atmosphere, ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration rates, will experience even larger adverse effects.\\n <p> second, the increased oxygen concentrations provided a new opportunity for biological diversification, as well as tremendous changes in the nature of chemical interactions between rocks, sand, clay, and other geological substrates and the earth's air, oceans, and other surface waters. despite the natural recycling of organic matter, life had remained energetically limited until the widespread availability of oxygen. this breakthrough in metabolic evolution greatly increased the free energy available to living organisms, with global environmental impacts. for example, mitochondria evolved after the goe, giving organisms the energy to exploit new, more complex morphology interacting in increasingly complex ecosystems, although these did not appear until the late proterozoic and cambrian \\n <p> on the early earth, when atmospheric oxygen levels were 0.001% of those present today, dissolved fe was thought to have been a lot more abundant in the oceans, and thus more bioavailable to microbial life in that era. at this time, before the onset of oxygenic photosynthesis, primary production may have been dominated by photoferrotrophs, which would obtain energy from sunlight, and use the electrons from fe to fix carbon.\\n <p> environmental oxygenation can be important to the sustainability of a particular ecosystem. the us environmental protection agency has published a table of maximum equilibrium dissolved oxygen concentration versus temperature at atmospheric pressure. the optimal levels in an estuary for dissolved oxygen is higher than 6 ppm. insufficient oxygen (environmental hypoxia), often caused by the decomposition of organic matter and/or nutrient pollution, may occur in bodies of water such as ponds and rivers, tending to suppress the presence of aerobic organisms such as fish. deoxygenation increases the relative population of anaerobic organisms such as plants and some bacteria, resulting in fish kills and other adverse events. the net effect is to alter the balance of nature by increasing the concentration of anaerobic over aerobic species.\\n <p> as primary production in the biosphere is an important part of the carbon cycle, estimating it at the global scale is important in earth system science. however, quantifying primary production at this scale is difficult because of the range of habitats on earth, and because of the impact of weather events (availability of sunlight, water) on its variability. using satellite-derived estimates of the normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) for terrestrial habitats and sea-surface chlorophyll for the oceans, it is estimated that the total (photoautotrophic) primary production for the earth was 104.9 petagrams of carbon per year (pg c yr; equivalent to the non-si gt c yr). of this, 56.4 pg c yr (53.8%), was the product of terrestrial organisms, while the remaining 48.5 pg c yr, was accounted for by oceanic production.\", 'answer': 'In order to get enough food to feed the population we need a lot of plants. And these plants alone is enough to produce oxygen for the population. It is basic chemistry that the amount of plants you need to generate enough food for a person produces exactly the same amount of oxygen that the person needs. This is also true if you consider that the plants is used to feed livestock for food as the livestock needs more plants but also require oxygen. So it is impossible to run out of oxygen without also running out of food.'}]\n","[{'question': 'direct x', 'context': '<p> microsoft directx is a collection of application programming interfaces (apis) for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on microsoft platforms. originally, the names of these apis all began with direct, such as direct3d, directdraw, directmusic, directplay, directsound, and so forth. the name \"directx\" was coined as a shorthand term for all of these apis (the \"x\" standing in for the particular api names) and soon became the name of the collection. when microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console, the \"x\" was used as the basis of the name xbox to indicate that the console was based on directx technology. the \"x\" initial has been carried forward in the naming of apis designed for the xbox such as xinput and the cross-platform audio creation tool (xact), while the directx pattern has been continued for windows apis such as direct2d and directwrite.\\n <p> an x–y plotter is a plotter that operates in two axes of motion (\"x\" and \"y\") in order to draw continuous vector graphics. the term was used to differentiate it from standard plotters which had control only of the \"y\" axis, the \"x\" axis being continuously fed to provide a plot of some variable with time. plotters differ from inkjet and laser printers in that a plotter draws a continuous line, much like a pen on paper, while inkjet and laser printers use a very fine matrix of dots to form images, such that while a line may appear continuous to the naked eye, it in fact is a discrete set of points. \\n <p> directx raytracing (dxr) is a feature of microsoft\\'s directx that allows for hardware real-time raytracing, a significant advancement in computer graphics first seen on the consumer level in gpus such as the nvidia geforce 20 series announced in 2018. dxr is not released as part of a new version of directx but rather as a compatible extension to directx 12.\\n <p> x.3 is an itu-t standard indicating what functions are to be performed by a packet assembler/disassembler (pad) when connecting character-mode data terminal equipment (dte), such as a computer terminal, to a packet switched network such as an x.25 network, and specifying the parameters that control this operation.\\n <p> directx is a collection of game apis. direct3d is directx\\'s 3d api. direct3d is freely available from microsoft, as are the rest of the directx apis. microsoft developed directx for game programmers and continues to add features to the api. the directx specification is not controlled by an open arbitration committee and microsoft is free to add, remove or change features. direct3d is not portable; it is designed specifically for microsoft windows and no other platform (though a form of direct3d is used on microsoft\\'s xbox, windows phone 7.5 smartphones and mobile devices which run the pocket pc operating system).\\n <p> similar to previous \"pokémon\" games, \"x\" and \"y\" both follow a linear storyline whose main events occur in a fixed order. the protagonist of \"pokémon x\" and \"y\" is a child who had just moved to a small town called vaniville town with their mother. they soon befriend four trainers—shauna, tierno, trevor, and their rival calem or serena,—all of whom were called to meet professor sycamore who is the leading professor in the kalos region in lumiose city, the main city of kalos. receiving either chespin, fennekin, or froakie as their starter pokémon from tierno, the player begins their adventure. along the way, they learn of pokémon gyms and receive their first badge for defeating viola, the santalune city gym leader. thereafter, they encounter sina and dexio, assistants of sycamore, who brings them to the professor himself; however, once in lumiose city they discover the area to be suffering from a partial power outage. upon meeting sycamore in lumiose city, the player is informed of mega evolution and he requests they travel across kalos and uncover the mysteries behind it. he provides them with one of the kanto region starter pokémon and their respective mega stone. before leaving lumiose city, the player encounters an imposing man named lysandre who desires a more beautiful world.\\n <p> the artwork for \"x&y\" was designed by graphic design duo tappin gofton, formed by mark tappin and simon gofton; mark tappin had previously worked for coldplay on the \"parachutes\" album cover and the covers of the singles therefrom. the image, which is visualized through a combination of colours and blocks, is a graphical representation of the baudot code, an early form of telegraph communication using a series of ones and zeros to communicate. the code was developed by frenchman émile baudot in the 1870s, and was a widely used method of terrestrial and telegraph communication.', 'answer': 'DirectX is the way that your game communicates with your graphics card.

One of the best insulators is just plain old air. Heat transfers in a few ways, but the one you're going to run into most in cold environments is conduction, where your warm stuff is touching cold stuff (air) and some of your energy leaves to the cold air. Insulation helps slow this down by having a barrier between your warm skin and the cold air. The less stuff is touching, the less heat can be transferred. Air isn't very dense, so it takes a while to transfer heat. The cold air in the arctic is *really* cold, though, and because it's windy it's always moving the relatively warm air away and replacing it with more *really* cold air. Fur traps some air around your skin, so the wind can't blow it away as much, and that warm air acts as a barrier against the much colder air so you don't lose as much heat. Around your face, the super cold air is cold enough to freeze the moisture in your breath as it leaves your mouth and nose.

So for some set of data, you calculate the mean, then you calculate how much each data point deviates from the mean, then you square those deviations, and then finally you average those squared deviations. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance (so standard deviation and the mean have the same units).

A high standard deviation means the data is very spread out from the mean.', 'question': 'what is variance', 'context': '<p> in probability theory and statistics, variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. informally, it measures how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their average value. variance has a central role in statistics, where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, and monte carlo sampling. variance is an important tool in the sciences, where statistical analysis of data is common. the variance is the square of the standard deviation, the second central moment of a distribution, and the covariance of the random variable with itself, and it is often represented by formula_1, formula_2, or formula_3.\\n <p> the variance is the covariance of the data with itself. if we now consider the same data but with a lag of formula_54, we can take the covariance of formula_45 with formula_56, and define this to be the autocorrelation function formula_57 of the signal (or data) formula_53:\\n <p> in statistics, the variance function is a smooth function which depicts the variance of a random quantity as a function of its mean. the variance function plays a large role in many settings of statistical modelling. it is a main ingredient in the generalized linear model framework and a tool used in non-parametric regression, semiparametric regression and functional data analysis. in parametric modeling, variance functions take on a parametric form and explicitly describe the relationship between the variance and the mean of a random quantity. in a non-parametric setting, the variance function is assumed to be a smooth function.\\n <p> analysis of variance (anova) is a data analysis technique for examining the significance of the factors (independent variables) in a multi-factor model. the one factor model can be thought of as a generalization of the two sample t-test. that is, the two sample t-test is a test of the hypothesis that two population means are equal. the one factor anova tests the hypothesis that \"k\" population means are equal. the standard anova assumes that the errors (i.e., residuals) are normally distributed. if this normality assumption is not valid, an alternative is to use a non-parametric test.\\n <p> in statistics, the two-way analysis of variance (anova) is an extension of the one-way anova that examines the influence of two different categorical independent variables on one continuous dependent variable. the two-way anova not only aims at assessing the main effect of each independent variable but also if there is any interaction between them.\\n <p> fisher defined his new term variance, as the square of the standard deviation, because of the manner in which variances of independent random variables may be added. he noted the continuous variation in human characters.\\n <p> in statistics, one purpose for the analysis of variance (anova) is to analyze differences in means between groups. the test statistic, \"f\", assumes independence of observations, homogeneous variances, and population normality. anova on ranks is a statistic designed for situations when the normality assumption has been violated.'}\n","{'answer': 'To get domain hosting for your website, you have to follow some simple procedures.

identifiable as the perpetrator\\'s home. this would in turn, erase the perpetrator\\'s very existence. \\n <p> a memory institution is an organization maintaining a repository of public knowledge, a generic term used about institutions such as libraries, archives, heritage (monuments & sites) institutions, aquaria and arboreta, and zoological and botanical gardens, as well as providers of digital libraries and data aggregation services which serve as memories for given societies or mankind. memory institutions serve the purpose of documenting, contextualizing, preserving and indexing elements of human culture and collective memory. these institutions allow and enable society to better understand themselves, their past, and how the past impacts their future. \\xa0these repositories are ultimately preservers of communities, languages, cultures, customs, tribes, and individuality. memory institutions are repositories of knowledge, while also being actors of the transitions of knowledge and memory to the community. these institutions ultimately remain some form of collective memory. increasingly such institutions are considered as a part of a unified documentation and information science perspective.\\n <p> the digital formation of sets and locations, especially in the time of growing film series and sequels, is that virtual sets, once computer generated and stored, can be easily revived for future films.\\n <p> although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. in fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed: \"current hypotheses suggest that constructive processes allow individuals to simulate and imagine future episodes, happenings, and scenarios. since the future is not an exact repetition of the past, simulation of future episodes requires a complex system that can draw on the past in a manner that flexibly extracts and recombines elements of previous experiences – a constructive rather than a reproductive system.\" people can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. to illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by elizabeth loftus and john palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. the researchers found that the people who were asked, \"how fast were the cars going when they \"smashed\" into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"how fast were the cars going when they \"hit\" each other?\" furthermore, when asked a week later whether they had seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with \"smashed\" were twice more likely to report that they had seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with \"hit\". there was no broken glass depicted in the film. thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers\\' memories of the event. importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event – those who were asked the question with \"smashed\" recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen. the findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect.\\n <p> virtual memory is an integral part of a modern computer architecture; implementations usually require hardware support, typically in the form of a memory management unit built into the cpu. while not necessary, emulators and virtual machines can employ hardware support to increase performance of their virtual memory implementations. consequently, older operating systems, such as those for the mainframes of the 1960s, and those for personal computers of the early to mid-1980s (e.g., dos), generally have no virtual memory functionality, though notable exceptions for mainframes of the 1960s include:'}\n","{'answer': 'Many international standards help in developing an effective information security plan in government agencies, including the

In a syphonophore (like the man of war) there are polyps and jellyfish all attached in one giant colony. What makes this many organisms and not just one? The answer is they all have their own genetic code. In a singular organism, all the cells in a body have the same genetic code. The syphonophore is made of many individual genetic codes.

Diet, general health, exercise, ... all play a part. Multiple eggs is a genetic trait that leads to more frequent twins, but that's a pretty uncommon thing for a doctor to say unless they were testing for that.\", 'question': 'what makes some woman more fertile than others?', 'context': '<p> several small studies have found that fertile women appear more attractive to men than women during infertile portions of her menstrual cycle, or women using hormonal contraception. it has also been suggested that a woman\\'s voice may become more attractive to men during this time. two small studies of monogamous human couples found that women initiated sex significantly more frequently when fertile, but male-initiated sex occurred at a constant rate, without regard to the woman\\'s phase of menstrual cycle. it may be that a woman\\'s awareness of men\\'s courtship signals increases during her highly fertile phase due to an enhanced olfactory awareness of chemicals specifically found in men\\'s body odor.\\n <p> generally, it is unusual for males within a species to be the choosy sex. there are many reasons for this. in humans, following sexual reproduction, the female is obliged to endure a nine-month pregnancy and childbirth. this means that females naturally provide a greater parental investment to offspring, than males. human males have a larger quantity of gametes than females, which are replenished at a rate of approximately 12 million per hour. conversely, female humans are born with a fixed amount of egg cells which are not restocked over the lifespan. this provides males with a greater window of opportunity to mate and reproduce than females, hence females are usually more choosy.\\n <p> however, some researchers have noted that the reason why women should be more competitive during the fertile window is unclear. the ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that women should be seeking short-term sexual partners at peak fertility, but men can effectively have multiple sexual partners, so competition over one high-quality man should not be necessary. if women were competing for a long-term partner, there is no reason why they should be more competitive during the fertile window than any other time in their cycle.\\n <p> in adults, fecundity is determined by the biological processes of reproduction. female fecundity is heavily influenced by reproduction and energetics. the ovarian cycle limits the potential of conception to a brief period of fertility roughly once a month. successful egg maturation, fertilization, and implantation must be able to occur for a reproductively mature female to be fecund. changes in energy levels, diet, and hormones can all interfere in this process. during breastfeeding, a period of lactational infertility also reduces female fecundity. the metabolic load hypothesis in human reproductive ecology describes how the energetic expenditure of lactation acts to inhibit ovarian cycling. with the majority of available energy going towards milk production, energy is not expended on reproductive effort.\\n <p> consistent with the hypothesis that women may seek high quality genes from short-term extra-pair partners at high fertility, several studies have shown that fertile-phase women are more attracted to, flirt more, and initiate sex more often, with men who are not their partner. in fact, women often report that attraction to their current partner does not increase during the fertile window, but both attraction and relationship satisfaction may actually decrease. studies have found that this effect is particularly strong when women do not perceive their current partner to be highly sexually attractive. women in relationships also tend to be more assertive and independent during the fertile phase. additionally, researchers have shown that women at \"low\" fertility tend to initiate sex with their primary partner more frequently, especially when they perceive their partner to be less invested in the relationship than they are, consistent with the idea that women seek investment in a long-term relationship when they are not likely to get pregnant.\\n <p> males typically produce billions of sperm each month, many of which are capable of fertilization. females typically produce one ovum a month that can be fertilized into an embryo. thus during a lifetime males are able to father a significantly greater number of children than females can give birth to. the most fertile female, according to the guinness book of world records, was the wife of feodor vassilyev of russia (1707–1782) who had 69 surviving children. the most prolific father of all time is believed to be the last sharifian emperor of morocco, mulai ismail (1646–1727) who reportedly fathered more than 800 children from a harem of 500 women.\\n <p> according to the parental investment theory, the gender that invests more in offspring tends to be more discriminating and more sociosexually restricted (usually women, due to pregnancy, childbirth and lactation). in a year, a woman can give birth once (except in the case of a multiple pregnancy), regardless of the number of partners she has had, whereas a man can potentially have more children than the number of women with whom he has slept due to multiple births. thus, women should be more selective and restricted in order to have children with partners possessing good genes and resources, who can provide for potential offspring. men, however, may increase their reproductive fitness by being unrestricted and having many children with many women. thus, since men do not need to invest as much physically (no pregnancy), they tend to have a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation.'}\n","{'answer': \"Your company's credit cannot be assigned to any other party, and is considered

however, at least one issue remains problematic: in all slavic languages, the word for sun, \"sunce\", is of neutral or feminine gender, never masculine (however, there is russian epic character vladimir beautiful sun which has the same place as arthur in english culture.) also, in baltic mythology, which is most akin to slavic, sun is a female deity, saule, while the moon is a male one. the same pattern can be observed in folklore of many slavic nations, where the sun is most often identified with mother or a bride, and moon with father or husband, their children being the stars. where exactly this leaves dažbog as a possible male solar deity of slavic pantheon remains questionable.\\n <p> the greek practice of grafting their gods\\' names onto the planets was almost certainly borrowed from the babylonians. the babylonians named phosphoros after their goddess of love, \"ishtar\"; pyroeis after their god of war, \"nergal\", stilbon after their god of wisdom nabu, and phaethon after their chief god, \"marduk\". there are too many concordances between greek and babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately. the translation was not perfect. for instance, the babylonian nergal was a god of war, and thus the greeks identified him with ares. unlike ares, nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.\\n <p> the germanic peoples adapted the system introduced by the romans but glossed their indigenous gods over the roman deities in a process known as \"interpretatio germanica\". in the case of saturday, however, the roman name was borrowed directly by west germanic peoples, apparently because none of the germanic gods were considered to be counterparts of the roman god saturn. otherwise old norse and old high german did not borrow the name of the roman god (icelandic \"laugardagur\", german \"samstag\").\\n <p> today, most people in the western world know the planets by names derived from the olympian pantheon of gods. although modern greeks still use their ancient names for the planets, other european languages, because of the influence of the roman empire and, later, the catholic church, use the roman (latin) names rather than the greek ones. the romans, who, like the greeks, were indo-europeans, shared with them a common pantheon under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that greek poetic culture had given their gods. during the later period of the roman republic, roman writers borrowed much of the greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon, to the point where they became virtually indistinguishable. when the romans studied greek astronomy, they gave the planets their own gods\\' names: \"mercurius\" (for hermes), \"venus\" (aphrodite), \"mars\" (ares), \"iuppiter\" (zeus) and \"saturnus\" (cronus). when subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was retained with \"neptūnus\" (poseidon). uranus is unique in that it is named for a greek deity rather than his roman counterpart.\\n <p> ancient egyptian deities represent natural and social phenomena, as well as abstract concepts. these gods and goddesses appear in virtually every aspect of ancient egyptian civilization, and more than 1,500 of them are known by name. many egyptian texts mention deities\\' names without indicating their character or role, while other texts refer to specific deities without even stating their name, so a complete list of them is difficult to assemble.\\n <p> from the history traced by nilsson and guthrie, the mycenaean pantheon consisted of minoan deities, but also of gods and goddesses who appear under different names with similar functions in east and west. many of these names appearing in the linear b inscriptions can be found later in classical greece like zeus, hera, poseidon, athena, hermes, eileithyia and dionysos, but the etymology is the only evidence of the cults.'}\n","{'answer': 'To sign an electronic document using a reliable electronic signature, you must commit to using a reliable electronic signature creation system that complies with the technical specifications determined by the Authority’s Board of Directors.

From superstition it's really just a matter of a bit of imagination to come up with the concepts of spirits and deities.\", 'question': 'why has virtually every human civilisation created a religion?', 'context': '<p> organised religion traces its roots to the neolithic revolution that began 11,000 years ago in the near east but may have occurred independently in several other locations around the world. the invention of agriculture transformed many human societies from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a sedentary lifestyle. the consequences of the neolithic revolution included a population explosion and an acceleration in the pace of technological development. the transition from foraging bands to states and empires precipitated more specialized and developed forms of religion that reflected the new social and political environment. while bands and small tribes possess supernatural beliefs, these beliefs do not serve to justify a central authority, justify transfer of wealth or maintain peace between unrelated individuals.\\n <p> because religion and political power are often intertwined particularly in early states, the archaeology of religion may also engage theories of power and inequality. john janusek’s study of tiwanaku religion, for example, explored the ways that religion served to integrate societies within the andean state. colonial regimes frequently justified expansion through a commitment to religious conversion; archaeologies of coloniality may therefore intersect with the archaeology of religion. james delle’s 2001 article on missions and landscape in jamaica and barbara voss’ work on missions, sexuality and empire demonstrate how religion has intersected with colonial regimes.\\n <p> religion is a prominent part of society, although the dominant religions have evolved. a merging of the major religious groups of the 20th century has resulted in the first amalgamated church, while voodoo is now mainstream. new religions include oprahism, robotology, and the banned religion of \"star trek\" fandom. religious figures include father changstein-el-gamal, the robot devil, reverend lionel preacherbot, and passing references to the space pope, who appears to be a large crocodile-like creature. several major holidays have robots associated with them, including the murderous robot santa and kwanzaa-bot. while very few episodes focus exclusively on religion within the \"futurama\" universe, they do cover a wide variety of subjects including predestination, prayer, the nature of salvation, and religious conversion.\\n <p> the vast majority of sacred natural sites were arguably founded by indigenous or folk religions and spiritualities, but many were subsequently adopted or co-opted by mainstream religions. there is consequently a considerable \\'layering\\' and mixing of religious and other spiritual or belief systems. within the larger mainstream religions there are many if not more autonomous or semi-autonomous sub-groups. while fifty per cent of the world\\'s population profess to belong to either christianity or islam and many others are hindus or buddhists, 80 per cent of all people ascribe to a mainstream religion, a large part of which continue to adhere to at least some traditional or folk religion. sacred natural sites are thus connected to a wide range of socio-cultural systems and institutions, some more complex than others, and to different dynamics of change and cultural interaction.\\n <p> religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, evangelists, imperialists, and traders. christianity, islam, buddhism, and more recently sects such as mormonism are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins.\\n <p> religions that are not considered organized religions, or only loosely so, include many indigenous and folk religions, such as traditional african religions, native american religions and prehistoric religions, as well as personal religions including some strands of hinduism.\\n <p> the origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. these diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. for example, monkey king, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the god of wealth in fuzhou after the novel \"journey to the west\" was issued in ming dynasty.'}\n","{'answer': 'The provisions of the law include all civil and commercial transactions that are drawn up and signed electronically in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the law, in addition to transactions approved by public authorities.
