I work for a company that has been accredited for a number of years, so I can tell you a little bit about the requirements. First of all, the company has to pass an accreditation test, which is basically a series of tests that the company must pass in order to be considered an accredited company. The company then has to submit a report to the accreditation authority detailing the results of the tests, as well as the requirements for the company to be accredited. This report is then submitted to the authority, and the authority then decides whether or not to grant the company its accreditation. If the company passes the test, then they are considered accredited. If they fail, then the company is not accredited, and they are no longer allowed to do business with the company. If a company does not pass the test then it is considered an unaccredited company, and it is not allowed to operate in the United States. In order to become accredited, a company must meet the following requirements: 1. They must meet all of the requirements listed above. 2. They have to meet the standards set forth by the authority. 3.\n","golden answer: \n","The approved company is committed to complying with the provisions of the relevant laws, executive instructions and regulations issued by the Authority. It must also ensure the accuracy of the data provided and deliver final reports on the services provided to customers. It must ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the information it obtains during its work with the customer, update the software regularly, and send a periodic report every six months that includes the information security services provided. It must also obtain the Authority’s approval for any modification to the tools and software used.\n","the question: \n","what are the basic services provided by information security companies that are accredited by the authority?\n","prediction answer: \n","I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I work for a company that is accredited by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and I can tell you that there are a number of services that are provided by the company that are accredited by DHS. For example, the company I work with does a lot of work for the DHS, and they have a list of things that they are required to do as part of their accreditation. One of the things they do is perform a security audit, which is basically a check to see if there are any security holes in the system. If there are, then the company is required to fix them, and if there aren't, then they are not. The other thing that the company does is perform audits of the systems that they work on. For instance, if there is a vulnerability in a system, they will do an audit of the system and see if they can fix it. If they can't fix it, they won't be allowed to work on the system anymore, and the company will be shut down. There are also other services that they provide, but these are the ones that I'm familiar with.\n","golden answer: \n","Certified information security companies provide several basic services, including developing information security policy, auditing information systems security, developing plans to deal with emergency incidents, risk assessment, security vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, recovering lost data, and security review of the code. These services ensure the protection of information infrastructure and enhance electronic security in private institutions, which contributes to reducing threats and reducing losses resulting from security incidents.\n","the question: \n","i want to subscribe to a shared hosting reservation but i want some details about the papers and procedures how it is done and where documents should be delivered\n","prediction answer: \n","If you want to subscribe to a shared hosting reservation but you want some details about the papers and procedures how it is done and where documents should be delivered, you should contact the hosting provider directly. If you don't want to contact the provider directly, you can contact your local hosting provider and ask them to help you out.\n","golden answer: \n","To subscribe to a shared hosting reservation, you must submit a set of required documents, which include a shared hosting form signed and stamped according to the approved form, a copy of an identity card in the case of individuals, a commercial register in the case of companies, or a license or declaration in the case of private or trade union bodies, in addition to a payment notice. Hosting fees are according to Wages Appendix No. (1). You can submit these documents either in paper form to the Authority’s approved address, or through the Authority’s website, or via the email of the Information Services Center, or by fax. After submitting the documents, the center will reserve the hosting for a period of one month if the required documents are sent by e-mail or fax, pending receipt of the original documents sent to the Authority to confirm the reservation.\n","the question: \n","what penalties does the authority impose on individuals or entities involved in crimes of forgery, distortion of an electronic signature, or illegal acquisition of electronic signature data, and what are the responsibilities that the electronic certification services provider bears in the event that such crimes are committed by its employees?\n","prediction answer: \n","I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but in the US, you can be charged with \"forgery of an electronic signature, data, or electronic signature creation system in any way\" with a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. You can also face a fine of up to $1,000,000 depending on the severity of the crime.\n","golden answer: \n","The Authority imposes strict penalties of up to one to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of five hundred thousand to two million Syrian pounds on those who commit crimes related to forgery, distorting an electronic signature, or illegally obtaining their data. Severe penalties, up to temporary hard labor, are also imposed if the forgery or illegal use of an electronic signature is on an official document. The provider of electronic certification services shall be jointly responsible with the violating worker for paying fines if his breach of management duties contributed to the occurrence of the crime, and the conviction ruling shall be published in two daily newspapers and on the Internet.\n","the question: \n","what obligations must the customer adhere to when using the hosting services of the national data center?\n","prediction answer: \n","It depends on the type of data center you're using. For example, if you're looking for a cloud hosting service, you're going to have to sign up for a contract with the company that owns the data center. You'll have to agree to the terms and conditions of the contract, and you'll also have to pay a fee to the company for the privilege of using their data centers. If you don't want to pay the fee, you can choose to go with a different provider.\n","golden answer: \n","When using the hosting services of the National Data Center, the customer must adhere to several matters. He must comply with everything stated in the hosting services system and the Syrian laws related to digital content, such as the Anti-Cybercrime Law and the Media Law.

One of the most important things to do is to make sure that the organization has a good idea of how the information is going to be used. For example, if you have a list of all the people who have access to a certain piece of information, you should be able to figure out how they are going to use that information. If you don't know how to use it, you can't do anything about it. Another important thing to keep in mind is that information is not a single thing. It's a collection of pieces of information that can be used in a variety of ways. For instance, you might have a spreadsheet that lists all the names of the people in your department, and then you can use that spreadsheet to determine who has access to that spreadsheet. You can also use the spreadsheet to find out who owns that spreadsheet, and how much money they have to pay for it, and so on. You could also use this spreadsheet to look up who owns the spreadsheet, so you can figure out what percentage of that spreadsheet is owned by the company, and what percentage by the person who owns it. You might also be able\n","golden answer: \n","To classify and protect information within an organization's information security management plan, several basic steps must be followed. First, policies for information classification must be defined and documented, which includes classifying data by importance and sensitivity and defining different levels of access. Second, it is explained how each category of information is used and protected, emphasizing the importance of using encryption to protect sensitive data. You should also define policies for managing access to information and ensure that access is restricted based on functionality and needs. Finally, a clear backup and emergency management plan should be in place to protect information from loss or hacking.\n","the question: \n","how can we protect the facilities used to process and store information from various threats?\n","prediction answer: \n","There are a number of ways to do this. One of the most common ways is to encrypt the data. This is done by encrypting the data in a way that makes it impossible for anyone to read it. For example, if you encrypt a file, you can't read it, but you can encrypt it so that no one else can see it. Another method is to store the data on a hard drive. This means that if someone steals the hard drive, they can't access the data, but they can still read the data stored on the drive. Another way to encrypt data is to use something called a \"crypto-signature\". This is a way of encrypting data so that it can only be read by someone who knows how to encrypt it.\n","golden answer: \n","Facilities used to process and store information can be protected from various threats by securing the surrounding physical environment to ensure the safe use of information assets.

One of the most important things is that the server is connected to the internet. When you connect to a website, it sends a request to the server. The server sends a response back to the website. If the server fails, the website doesn't get the response it was expecting. This can cause the website to slow down, or even crash. Another thing that can happen is that one of the components of the server may not be working properly. For example, the server might not be able to handle the amount of requests that are being sent to it, or it might be unable to handle all the responses that are coming in at once. This could cause the site to crash.\n","golden answer: \n","Server problems greatly affect the performance and stability of the website. Server failure or slowness leads to a poor user experience, which reduces the traffic rate and negatively affects search engine rankings. When a site becomes unavailable or slow, visitors can become frustrated and leave the site before pages fully load, reducing engagement and potential sales. In addition, persistent problems can lead to deterioration of the site's reputation and increased bounce rates, which is a big problem especially if there is strong competition in the market.\n","the question: \n","what are the prerequisites for learning jquery and how does understanding javascript contribute to this context?\n","prediction answer: \n","Javascript is a programming language that allows you to write code that can be interpreted by other programs.

The US and Canada have different sizes, shapes, and colors of coins, but they're not exactly the same. For example, the US has a 1 cent coin and a 10 cent coin, while the Canadian coins have a 1 dollar coin, and a 1/5 cent coin.\n","golden answer: \n","This is pure conjecture, but perhaps it is a relic of past times when the value of a coin was tied to the value of the metal used to make it. Gold is the most valuable, so you could have a $5, $10, $20, etc coin, with the value determined by how much gold is in it. Silver is less valuable, and in the US, quarters were silver until 1965. For the smaller denominations, nickel or copper are used, these being metals of even lesser value. I would imagine a couple hundred years ago when the US and Canada started making their coins, the amount and type of metal used to make a coin of a certain value would have been similar, so the size, shape and color of each coin is the same. Now that it's all fiat money anyway, all the coins are made with less valuable materials, but the basic design of each coin has remained the same.\n","the question: \n","in films, when a gun, usually a pistol, is dropped or thrown onto the ground, it will sometimes fire. is this something real guns do too, and if so, why, since the trigger isn't being pulled?\n","prediction answer: \n","It's called a cook-off. When the gun is dropped or thrown onto the ground, the propellant in the cartridge heats up to the point that it will ignite and fire the cartridge on its own (a cookoff). It's not something real guns do too, and if so, since the trigger isn't being pulled, it would continue to fire uncontrollably until the ammunition ran out.\n","golden answer: \n","So, to fire a gun there is a firing pin, which you can see in this gif striking the back of a cartridge, igniting the powder and firing the gun. *Most* cartridges are center fire, with a primer in the middle (the silvery middle part of the back of a cartridge) but some are rim fire. Here is an illustration of the difference, and here is a picture of the two. The firing pin hits the primer, which ignites the powder, which fires the bullet. But it's not just a light tap, it has to strike with a decent amount of force. In order to do that, the hammer (the part you cock back on a pistol, highlighted here is spring-loaded. When you cock it, the hammer is pulled against the spring and held in place until you pull the trigger, which releases the hammer, which hits the firing pin (or is attached to it), which hits the primer...etc. There are two ways dropping a handgun can cause it to fire. If the hammer is cocked and you drop it, you may jar the hammer so that it slips past the mechanism holding it back, in which case it slams into the firing pin just like it's supposed to do, as if you had pulled the trigger. That is not good, and it's also why you should never keep your firearm cocked until you're ready to use it. But as u/NO_LATTE_NO_PEACE pointed out, many pistols are double-action, so you don't have to cock the hammer first. The hammer is cocked *as you pull the trigger* until you reach a point in the swing of the trigger that releases the hammer. If it's an automatic or semi-automatic weapon, the firing action reloads the gun and cocks the hammer again. Single-action weapons, like the revolvers of the old west, require you to cock the hammer each time you want to fire, before you pull the trigger. So if you're carrying a weapon for personal defense, it's probably going to be a double-action, in which case you can carry it without it being cocked and you don't have to worry about wasting the time to cock it. Single-action weapons are generally considered to be simpler and more reliable. But that's neither here nor there. The other way a weapon might fire when dropped is if it lands directly on the hammer. In that case, when the hammer hits the ground and transfers the energy of the drop into the hammer, it pushes the hammer against the firing pin with a lot of force, exactly as if the hammer had been released by the trigger. The floor hits the hammer, which hits the firing pin, which hits the primer...etc. However, most modern weapons will not allow the firing pin to touch the back of the cartridge unless the hammer has been cocked first. There is a mechanism in place that gets between the hammer and the firing pin or prevents the hammer from moving forward unless it's been cocked and/or the trigger is pulled. With those weapons, you can bang on it as hard as you want and it will not go off... \\* \\* Until the gunpowder ignites from the shock, which is a thing gunpowder can do. It's *possible* that if you dropped a gun from high enough the sheer force of hitting the ground would set off the gunpowder, but...that's not a realistic possibility. It certainly won't happen from you dropping it from your hand onto the ground. It *used* to be more common, partly because guns were not designed with the safety features to prevent the firing pin from touching the cartridge. Older guns simply rested the firing pin against the back of the cartridge, and the hammer against the firing pin when it wasn't cocked. Obviously, this is pretty unsafe, but hey, guns were still being improved upon so no one had anything better at the time. We have also significantly improved our understanding of gun safety when we handle weapons so people to know better than to keep a gun cocked when you aren't about to immediately fire it, and technologies like double-action weapons have allowed people to be more comfortable because they don't need to have the weapon cocked before the gunfight starts. Today it's very uncommon, unless someone is mishandling the gun, the mechanism is malfunctioning, or most likely, both.\n","the question: \n","who decides what the next \"superfood\" is? how did we not already know something is good for us? is it just a marketing ploy to get rid of old stock?\n","prediction answer: \n","It's just a marketing ploy to get rid of old stock. We don't know what the next \"superfood\" is, but we do know that it's not good for us. It's just that we don't have any evidence to back it up, so we just call it what we want to call it.\n","golden answer: \n","Very frequently it is completely marketing, with little to no research backing up the claims. \"Superfood\" is not a regulated term, so anyone can slap it on their product, and anyone can write a blog post claiming that anything is a superfood. That said, dietary research *is* an active science, and new discoveries are frequently made. Many are not obvious; yes, \"vitamin C is good for you\" is an easy one, but other chemicals have more complex pathways and are formed from different chemicals your food gives you. For instance, new research shows that chicken eggs are excellent at helping your body produce chemicals used to develop the brain; this was not obvious previously, even though we knew a lot about the chemical makeup of eggs. Be wary of the term \"superfood\" when you see it in the world, but know that it isn't always snake oil.

The main difference between fly fishing and other types of angling is that a fly angler strips the line off the reel with one hand while casting and manipulating the rod with the other. The basic idea of most surf fishing is to cast a lure or bait into the surf, from sandy and rocky beaches, rock jetties, etc.\n","golden answer: \n","fly fishing uses an extremely light line and lure - not bait, usually something as light and basic as a small collection of feathers with a small hook. To cast, you whip the line back and forwards, feeding out more line with each pendulum swing so you can build enough momentum to send the tiny lure out far enough. This is to catch surface hunting fish that go after small insects that land on a river's surface. You need a big open space to do it in and a lot of practice getting the pendulum swing right. Other types of fishing usually involve casting something with a bit of weight, directly where you think fish are, something that isn't really possible with such a light lure\n","the question: \n","why there are not any new popular religions?\n","prediction answer: \n","I don't know of any new popular religions, but I do know that there are a lot of new religions that have been around for a long time.

He knew that the protons and neutrons in the nucleus had the same charge to mass ratio as the electrons and protons, and that they were the same size. He also knew that hydrogen was the smallest element in the periodic table, so he knew that it contained only one proton and one electron.\n","golden answer: \n","Rutherford was influenced by Prout's hypothesis that all atoms were made up of groups of hydrogen atoms, with the hydrogen atom being the fundamental particle. The logic was that the atomic weights known at the time were almost exactly integer multiples of the mass of hydrogen. If there were smaller particles, there would be smaller elements or elements with masses that fell in between multiples of hydrogen. Obviously Rutherford discovered that an atom wasn't just one particle but a positive nucleus surrounded by negative electrons, and then when he observed the process of nitrogen atoms releasing hydrogen atoms when bombarded by alpha particles he took this as evidence that the hydrogen nucleus is indeed the fundamental building block for all other nuclei. This was before the neutron was discovered, it was believed that the nucleus was only made of positive charges. Of course, protons are actually made up of quarks with fractional charges but there was no way to know that at the time.\n","the question: \n","what was otto von bismarck's motivation(s) for creating a welfare state in germany during the 1880s?\n","prediction answer: \n","Bismarck's motivation for creating a welfare state in Germany during the 1880s was twofold. First, he wanted to make sure that the German people were more loyal to the monarchy and to the state. He also wanted to ensure that the state was able to provide for the needs of the people. The second motivation was that he wanted the state to be able to protect the interests of the working class. He wanted the government to have the power to regulate the economy in order to ensure the safety of the workers and the economy as a whole.\n","golden answer: \n","Bismarck led the creation of a welfare state for a few main reasons: * Reduce social unrest, and prevent an uprising like the Paris Commune of 1871. Bismarck wanted to reduce worker support for the socialists, and also make sure that the working classes supported the German empire project (which realistically could have dissolved following massive unrest). * Encourage workers not to emigrate, as many were leaving for the eastern USA, which was industrializing as well * He combined protectionism with new welfare policies to foster German heavy industry, which many saw to be key to both economic and military success There had also been welfare policies in place (often dealing with some kind of healthcare or pensions) in some German states, like Saxony, prior to unification, and these had proved to be *not a bad thing.* The existing models formed the base of the welfare that was provided across the German empire.\n","the question: \n","why did portugal not declare war on japan when japan invaded portuguese east timor in the 2nd world war\n","prediction answer: \n","The Portuguese didn't declare war on Japan because they didn't have the resources to do so. The Japanese invaded East Timor in 1942, and the Portuguese did not declare war against them because they did not have enough resources to fight a war against the Japanese. They also did not want to start a war with the Japanese because they feared that the Japanese would use the war as an excuse to invade the rest of the world.\n","golden answer: \n","Because Portugal did not have the capacity nor the inclination to fight Japan. The Portuguese East Timor garrison consisted of an understrength colonial battalion of one colonial company, a very small militia force and a mounted border police unit, a grand total of 282 men with 4 light and 6 heavy machine guns and no artillery at all. East Timor had already been invaded, under local Portuguese protest, by Australian forces who recognised that the island could not be held by only defending the western (Dutch) part on the 17th of December 1941. When Japan invaded on the 19th of February 1942, there was a convoy heading for East Timor carrying two companies of Mozambique colonial troops and artillery, but this force was not allowed passage by the Japanese, and the Portuguese troops which had intended to replace the Austrialian and Dutch East Indees troops - a force of about 800 men with a battery of artillery had to turn around and head back for Portuguese Mozambique.\n","the question: \n","how did commoners before the advent of photographs recognize \"famous people\" in the past without seeing them before?\n","prediction answer: \n","I don't know if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you an example of how commoners could recognize famous people in the past without seeing them before. I'm not sure if it's the same as what you are asking, but here's a picture of a famous person from the past.\n","golden answer: \n","Through out the republican and imperial periods of Roman history, important figures like consuls, generals, senators, and later emperors were issued with official types of their portraiture. This consisted of an approved (by some authority, whether the artist or subject or both is contested) bust of their head. So all statues of them would use replicas of their head to have a standard look that people could recognise. The Prima Porta type is the most famous for the emperor Augustus(I was just looking at the eponymous statue of the type yesterday in Oxford's Ashmoleon for a paper I'm writing) and would probably be recognisable to people familiar with Augustus as it has over 140 replicas still in existence. The types could change over time and are not seen as perfect examples of what they looked like although in most cases we'll never know, but we are sure of the level at which this affected the mass conception of how people thought their rulers looked. Similar forms were also used on coinage that was minted by senators and emperors which were far more widespread than any statue and handed over far and wide. After Rome fell the level of recognisability fell greatly as the level of centralisation required for mass produced images simply was was not reached again for centuries in the west. In the east imperial images of emperors and the like was a bit more centralised but I am unaware of the specifics and how widespread images were as I am not an expert in that field unfortunately.

The United States is also sanctioning the Venezuelan government because they are using the oil industry as a way to enrich themselves, which is illegal under international law.\n","golden answer: \n","Over the past 20 years Venezuela socialized their industry and began running the government very poorly. One instance is that they started setting rules on how much stores could charge for food so that everyone could afford it. The stores couldn't afford to sell anymore so they restricted how much the farmers could charge. Then the farmers could no longer make a living so Venezuela stopped producing much of their food. Fortunately for them, they had a lot of oil and it sold for a lot of money and the government could subsidize imports. Unfortunately, there is something called a resource curse in which governments get rich and corrupt at the expense of their people. When the price of oil dropped the country fell into turmoil but the government would not deal with the rampant corruption. Hugo Chavez, the president who made all these changes, died in 2013 and put vice president Maduro in charge. In the midst of these struggles he outlawed opponents and won the next election. Many of the people of Venezuela, many countries around the world, and most of the Western Hemisphere including the US believe the elections were fraudulent and are calling for Maduro to step down. Maduro has not taken this well and the country is getting worse. Aid trucks were sent in to help, but the convoy was blocked. During the ensuing riot the supplies were destroyed. It looks like one of the people protesting the government accidentally started it with a poorly thrown Molotov cocktail (the burning rag fell out of the bottle while being thrown), but that the situation could even exist shows there is a problem between the government and the people. The problem is that the industries are nationalized so whatever money goes in through exports like oil goes to him. His supporters will be supplied while the average people suffer. Edit: Additionally, Venezuela also appears to be working with Russia in making threats against the US. So, another part of Cold War II\n","the question: \n","has any modern leader of a western country made a controversial decision/order that no one expected once he became the leader?\n","prediction answer: \n","I'm not sure if this counts as a \"controversial\" decision, but in the early days of the Spanish Empire, there was a lot of tension between the Spanish and the Portuguese. The Portuguese wanted to establish a colony in the Americas, but the Spanish wanted to keep the colony in Spain. So, the Portuguese decided to give the colony to the Spanish in exchange for a promise that the Spanish would not interfere in the affairs of the colony. The Spanish didn't like the idea, but they didn't want to give up control over the colony, so they gave it to the Portuguese in return for the promise that they wouldn't interfere with the colony's affairs. This was a controversial decision, because it meant that the Portuguese didn't have the authority to do what they wanted to do.\n","golden answer: \n","Lyndon Johnson was a Democrat from Texas. He stunned the Southern Democrats by strongly supporting the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A huge swath of these Southern Democrats defected to the Republican Party and that greatly helped Richard Nixon win the 1968 presidential election with his southern strategy. Storm Thurmond and Trent Lott were two prominant Republican US senators in the late 20th century, who started their political careers as Democrats.\n","the question: \n","language of the american founding fathers\n","prediction answer: \n","I can't speak to the language of the founding fathers, but I can tell you that they spoke a very different language than we do today. They spoke a different dialect of Latin, which is a language that is very different from the language we speak today. Latin is a very old language, dating back to the Middle Ages, and it was the language spoken by many of the people who founded the United States. The language that the Founding Fathers spoke was very different than the language that we use today. It was a different language that was spoken by different people in different parts of the country at different times in different places in the world. The difference between the two languages is that Latin is very old, while English is very new. The differences between the languages of the Founders and the English spoken today are a result of a number of factors. The first is that the English language is much older than the French language. The French language has been around for a very long time, and has been used by many people throughout the world for a long time. The English language, on the other hand, has only been around since the beginning of the 20th century. The second factor is that English is a much older language than the Latin language, and so it has been\n","golden answer: \n","Is your question about the use of the word \"militia\" or the use of dictionaries? If you're asking about militias, the _URL_10_ definition is correct. In all the colonies, able-bodied men from the ages of 16 to 60 were typically required to join the county militia. Later on, this would change to the ages of 18 to 45, as the states became more populated and there were more young men available to serve. This would require them to go do training a few weekends each summer, and maybe a couple more weekends throughout the year. A 1647 Massachusetts law stipulated that militia men were to receive eight days of training every year. Some people were exempt from service, such as the clergy, Quakers, members of the legislature, and the infirm, but everybody else had to serve, or else they would be subject to legal punishments, such as jail time. In many cases, you couldn't hold public office unless you were a member of the militia, either. Because of the large number of men required to join, militia muster rolls are often used as census substitutes for research purposes, particularly before the U.S. Census began being conducted in 1790. To more directly answer this question (if it is the question you're asking), another group that was exempt from militia duty were paid soldiers, such as those who joined up with Washington's Continental Army, or before that, those who had joined to serve alongside the British Army or Royal Navy, which would often happen during wartime--during one of the French and Indian Wars, for example. And then after that, this would have also included enlisted soldiers in the U.S. Army and Navy. There were active duty militias during times of war, but for the most part, the militias were reserve soldiers, only called up when the war front came close to their home county. If you're asking about dictionaries, then the one that would have been most available to the founders was *A Dictionary of the English Language* by Samuel Johnson, first published in London in 1755. Noah Webster published his first provisional dictionary in 1806, under the title *A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language*, although it was his later 1828 dictionary, *An American Dictionary of the English Language*, that was his first comprehensive dictionary. In the earlier 1806 dictionary, Webster wrote in the preface about Samuel Johnson's dictionary at length. It was clearly *the* standard by which English language dictionaries were compared to at the time. He also wrote in that preface a little about Nathan Bailey's *An Universal Etymological English Dictionary* first published in 1721. More briefly, Webster's preface mentioned Robert *Lowth's Grammar* published in 1762, and Thomas Sheridan's *A General Dictionary of the English Language* published in 1780. Webster also mentioned dictionaries by several other writers, including Walker, Entick, Perry, Ash, and Jones, all published between 1775 and 1800. But these were all mainly pronunciation dictionaries, rather than definitional dictionaries, so Johnson's and Bailey's dictionaries were the most useful to Noah Webster when he began the long work to compiling his American dictionary.\n","the question: \n","how did east timor come to exist?\n","prediction answer: \n","East Timor was colonized by the Portuguese in the early 16th century. The Portuguese established outposts in Timor and Maluku. The Dutch East Indies secured its independence as the Republic of Indonesia and the Portuguese, meanwhile, re-established East Timor as an independent state. The Indonesian military launched an invasion in December 1975. The Japanese eventually drove the last of the Australian and Allied forces out. However, following the end of World War II and Japanese surrender, Portuguese control was reinstated.\n","golden answer: \n","You assume right. The (whole) island of Timor was first conquered and administered by Portuguese colonialists, from the 16th century onwards. They set up both commercial outposts and catholic missions. From the 17th century onwards, the Dutch came over and conquered nearly all of Indonesia, including Western Timor. However, they faced resistance from the Portuguese, and Topasses - native Timorians of Portuguese descent -, and Eastern Timor remained under Portuguese administration. Fast forward real quick to 1975. Portugal has just gotten rid of its dictatorship following a revolution, and its government decided to disengage from its remaining colonies in Asia. Independentists in Timor unilaterally declared independence, virtually unopposed **by the Portuguese Government** However, Indonesia attacked, occupied and annexed East Timor right off the bat, in 1976. Note that East Timor's government was left-leaning, and with the Cold War and all, the US & co. favored Indonesia in this war. :) Indonesian occupation was nightmarish from a Human Rights point of view, you got that right. UN mediation finally led to a solution to the crisis, and eventually East Timor became independent in 2002. Here is a recap I found on Google Books.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head that comes to mind would be the Revolt of the Third Servile War (73-71 BC). Spartacus was a Thracian slave who had escaped from the Roman slave school in Capua, Italy. Spartacus and about 70 to 78 followers escaped. The break-out led to the slave rebellion against the Roman Empire, which was suppressed by the Romans.\n","golden answer: \n","One armed rebellion with no external support was Spartacus' rebellion against Rome (or the Third Servile War). Spartacus was a gladiator who led a group of gladiators in a bid for freedom. Eventually, Spartacus collected about 70,000 followers from escaped or liberated slaves. He trained an army from these followers, defeated three Roman forces sent to subdue him, and held out for two years. Initially, Spartacus was helped by the Romans having no legions in the area, their forces being off fighting against a revolt in Hispania and in the Third Mithridatic War in Asia. Although these concurrent wars were somewhat helpful to Spartacus, the Roman enemies in these wars were never supporters or allies of Spartacus. Spartacus tried to get some external support when he made a bargain with Cicilian pirates to transport his forces out of Southern Italy (where they were trapped by the Romans) across the straits of Messina to Sicily. The pirates took his money and sailed away, abandoning his forces. Spartacus was defeated after two years of rebellion by Roman legions under Crassus.

Were any of them successful?\n","the question: \n","just how dangerous is it to use a huawei device?\n","prediction answer: \n","It depends on what you mean by \"dangerous\". If you mean something that can be used to spy on you, then yes, it is dangerous. If you are talking about something that could be used for espionage, then no, it isn't dangerous.

This was partly motivated by the fear that Pius IX and his successors would use papal infallibility to achieve the \"papal desire for international political hegemony.... The result was the creation of the German Empire, which was the largest state in the new German Empire and the largest Protestant nation in the world.\"\n","golden answer: \n","> a way for Protestants to equate German national identity with Protestantism in an attempt to more fully unify the country. Nope, that's a fundamental misconception. The Kulturkampf was about the separation of church and state, not about protestant powers. Bismarck wanted to consolidate the power of the Prussian government and administration. Most of them were protestants, as the core of Prussia was protestant, but it was not a fight between protestants and catholics, it was the Prussian government vs. the Catholic church. In some parts of Prussia, like Cologne or Poland, the catholic church had more influence and power (eg. through welfare services) than the government. The Lutheran church never had that influence in the core of Prussia, since it was not as rich as the catholic one and esp. Friedrich der Große had a more enlightened laissez faire relationship to religion. The term was coined by Rudolf Virchow and is usually attributed to the fight between Prussia and the Catholic Church, but other German states (Bavaria, Baden) had their Kulturkampf too. The laws about supervision of schools and the introduction of civil marriage in Germany were against *every* church in Germany, not just the catholic. You should also have a look at the *Walk to Canossa*, Bismarck stated in the Reichstag, that he will not walk to Canossa. That might explain some of cultural background.\n","the question: \n","were the british as cruel to the irish as they're depicted in the wind that shakes the barley?\n","prediction answer: \n","The Irish were not as cruel to the British as they're depicted in the wind that shakes the barley. In fact, the British were far more brutal to the Irish than the Irish portrayed in the Wind that Shakes the Barley. The Irish were treated as second class citizens in the British system of government. They were not allowed to vote in Parliament, could not own land, and could not hold public office. They had to be indentured servants, which meant that they had to work hard to earn their living, and they were subject to the same laws that the English did. This meant that many Irish people were forced to work for the British government, and many of them died as a result of the harsh treatment they were subjected to.\n","golden answer: \n","A good primary source for this question would be Peter Beresford Ellis' *Eyewitness to Irish History* which presents, amongst other things, the majority of the Penal Laws which affected Catholics and non-Anglicans alike for the majority of the time they were in effect. Catholics, Non-Conformists (Calvinists), and other non-Anglicans were barred from holding office or being elected to any position, could not vote, could be pressed into service by any landholder Anglican for whatever price he named (refusal brought beatings, arrest, and deportation), Catholics and non-Conformists were barred from receiving education at home or abroad (on penalty of death in most cases), could not own a horse worth more than 5 pounds sterling, were barred from owning weapons, were forced to divide their property evenly amongst their heirs, and so on. Additionally, the book chronicles the treatment of non-Conformists and Catholics at the hands of Cromwell's army (Cromwell only stayed for a year in Ireland, but his son-in-law was arguable just as happy to be malicious and cruel towards the Irish) including 50,000 Irish sent into slavery in Barbados and the razing of entire towns. That being said, many of the radicals and revolutionaries of Ireland were Protestants, even Anglicans, who were outraged at the treatment of their fellow Irishmen; Theobald Wolfe Tone, Robert Emmet, and Charles Stuart Parnell were all Protestants. But the **Wind that Shakes the Barley** takes place int he immediate run-up to the 1916 uprising to the middle-ish part of the Irish Civil War. During the film's first half, you are treated to the lawlessness and butchery of the infamous \"Black and Tans\" and \"Auxies\" who **DID** go door-to-door killing innocent people suspected of being Feinian/IRA. THey mass-raped, burned people out, and generally ran roughshod over people with little or no oversight. The Black and Tans' behavior, coupled with battle exhaustion of the British public, made the fight against the revolution untenable and thus brought both sides to the negotiation table. TL;DR: it is a qualified \"Yes\" - the English were (to borrow a phrase) \"Right bastards\" towards Irish (Catholic and non-Conformists) during much of the time they ruled the island, with few exceptions.\n","the question: \n","why do cops wear oxford shoes rather than running/sports shoes? wouldn't they be more mobile with the latter?\n","prediction answer: \n","Oxford shoes are more comfortable than running shoes, but they are also more expensive, so they are more likely to be worn by people who don't want to spend a lot of money on a pair of shoes that aren't going to last a long time.

However, the Treaty of Strasbourg was the first step in the division of the Carolingian Empire into three parts: the Western Frankish Realm, the East Frankish realm, and the East German Realm. The West Frankish and East German realms were united into the Holy Roman Empire in 880. The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Francish realm and Louis the Bald) and Louis of Burgundy, the third son of Louis the Pious, who was co-Emperor in 850. The territory between the Rhine and Rhone Rivers was collectively called the Central Francish Realm. Louis was guaranteed the Kingship of all lands west of the Rhone and to the north and east of Italy, which was the precursor to modern Germany.\n","golden answer: \n","Charlemagne and his son Louis the Pious were the last emperors that ruled over a united Frankish Empire. Frankish custom made it so that heritage of a dead father was split between his sons. So the three sons of Louis divided the Empire in three parts with the Treaty of Verdun in 843 after a civil war had raged for three years. Lothair became emperor and claimed the Middle-Empire. Louis the German in Bavaria or the eastern part, and Charles the Bald in Aquitaine or the western part. Middle-Francia did not last long however, and was contest by both the East-Franks and the West-Franks. However, the east and west parts lasted longer (a few centuries), but eventually could not resist outside pressure of the Vikings and Magyars. Central control crumbled and regional leaders grew in power. This happend in both the western part as the eastern part, where new dynasties came into power. With the fall of Franks the western part and the eastern part were divided forever and came to be as France and Germany.\n","the question: \n","jupiter is sometimes referred to as a failed star, too small to achieve nuclear fusion. if a neptune sized planet crashed into jupiter would it be big enough to be a star then and give us a small second star in our solar system?\n","prediction answer: \n","Jupiter's mass is 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, so it would need to be about 75 times as massive to fuse hydrogen and become a star.

The remineralized tooth surfaces contain fluoridated hydroxyapatin, which resist acid attack much better than the original tooth did. Fluoride therapy is used to help prevent dental decay.\n","golden answer: \n","Fluoride ions bind to enamel and turn hydroxyapatite into fluoroapatite.

If you want to learn something new, you need to learn how to make connections between neurons. You can do this by using your brain to learn new things, or you can use it to strengthen existing connections. This is called long-term potentiation (LTP).\n","golden answer: \n","I'm no neuroscientist, but I took a couple related courses in college. The general principle is called \"synaptic plasticity\" which basically means that transmission of signals within your brain strengthens or weakens over time as a function of activity. A \"synapse\" is the connection between two neurons through which electrical potential is transmitted from one neuron to the next. As a specific part of the brain is used, the synapses within that channel become stronger through a variety of mechanisms, including increased quantities of neurotransmitters released by the axon terminals (sort of the \"tail end\") of the pre-synaptic neuron and enhanced responsiveness of receptors within the dendrites (\"head\") of the post-synaptic neuron. Let's put this into football terms: your pre-synaptic neuron is your quarterback, let's say...Dak Prescott. Your post-synaptic neuron is a receiver, Dez Bryant. Early in the season, Prescott didn't throw to Bryant all that often, because the chemistry/connection, the \"synapse\" per se, wasn't great. As they practiced together and gained trust in each other, that connected strengthened, and they became a more effective pair, both because Dak got a better idea of where to put the ball for Dez to catch it (bigger signal from the pre-synaptic neuron), and Dez had a better idea of where the ball was going to be and when (better receptiveness of the post-synaptic neuron). Likewise, if they stop practicing/playing together for a while, this relationship will diminish, and they will have to rebuild the connection just as you will with particular connections/pathways in your brain.\n","the question: \n","zeno's paradox, the grandfather paradox, searle's chinese room, hilbert's hotel, einstein's twin paradox and schrodinger's cat all explained like you're 5 (youtube link)\n","prediction answer: \n","Zeno's paradox, the grandfather paradox, searle's chinese room, hilbert's hotel, einstein's twin paradox and schrodinger's cat all explained like you're 5 (youtube link) If you want to learn more about them, check out the wikipedia page on them.

It can be used for a variety of things, but the main reason it's used is to train people for a specific job. For example, if you want to be a software developer, you need to be able to do a lot of work in a short amount of time, but you can only do so much at a time. If you can't do that, you have to hire someone else to do it for you. The problem is that there are only so many people who can do that job, so there's a limit to how many people can do it in a given time. There's also a cap on the number of visas that can be issued per year, which means that if there are too many people applying for the same job, they'll run out of visas in a few years. If there's too few people applying, there will be a shortage of workers, and the government will have to cut back on how many visas it can issue per year. This is bad for the economy, because it means that companies can't hire as many people as they need, and they can't pay as well.\n","golden answer: \n","The H1-B visa is a type of work visa for people in certain high-skill positions, like software developers and engineers, to come work in the United States. There's only a limited number of these visas available every year, and the spots fill up very quickly. In order to qualify for an H1-B visa, you need to have a job offer, that job offer needs to pay just as much as you would pay an American citizen, and the employer needs to have tried to hire American citizens but been unable to find any that meet the qualifications. The applicant also needs to have a college degree in a relevant field. The visa is tied to the job offer, so if the employee gets fired, they have to go back to their home country (although if they get a new job within a set time frame, the new employer can file paperwork to get a new visa for the immigrant without having to go through the whole process). The fraud that was found is that people were creating fake jobs to get people over here. While some major companies, like Microsoft and Intel, use the H1-B to hire top talent from around the world and bring them to their US headquarters to work, there are also outsourcing and consulting companies that (ab)use the process. They file for tens of thousands of petitions for H1-B visas every year. They use different job titles for their employees than most of the big employers (like \"computer programmer\" instead of \"software developer\") so that the official \"average salary\" is lower and they can pay them less than an American citizen would normally get paid for the same duties. Other companies will then fire their IT staff and hire the outsourcing company, effectively letting expensive American workers go and replacing them with cheap imported labor but without technically running afoul of immigration law. So, what would happen if the visa was abolished? Well, the major tech companies would probably still hire those people, but they'd have them work in India, Ireland, Switzerland, or wherever they had permission to work instead of bringing them to the US. The outsourcing companies would probably have more trouble if their supply of cheap labor dried up.\n","the question: \n","why does a neutron star spin faster when it is part of a binary system?\n","prediction answer: \n","A neutron star doesn't spin faster when it is part of a binary system. A binary system is a system of stars orbiting each other. A neutron star is a neutron star orbiting a black hole, and the black hole is orbiting a white dwarf. The black hole orbits the neutron star, and so on and so forth.\n","golden answer: \n","There are a couple of steps missing in there from \"in a binary\" to \"fast rotation\". Most neutron stars/pulsars are \"born\" with a spin period much faster than a second; the Crab has a 33 ms period and we know it was born in 1054 AD. Since they are emitting radiation in the form of a beam, they lose energy, and as they do so they start slowing down. Eventually they start reaching spin periods well over a second, and then maybe even into the 10s of seconds. Somewhere in there, they are moving too slowly for the radiation beam to be seen and they turn \"off\". If the pulsar is in a binary, then as the companion star starts to enter its end of life phase and begins to increase in size, the outer layers of that star will get accreted (pulled) onto the neutron star. There will be a transfer of angular momentum which causes the neutron star to spin up. Eventually what you're left with is a white dwarf companion, what is left of the core of that devoured star, and a very rapidly spinning \"millisecond pulsar\". The term millisecond pulsar is a little confusing because in some sense, by spin period definitions, the Crab is a millisecond pulsar. But we instead usually refer to a millisecond pulsar as being \"recycled\". That is, it accretes material/angular momentum, spins back up, and turns back \"on\" so that it shines again as a pulsar, and thus is recycled. There are a number of millisecond pulsars known with spin period just above 1 ms, and so far none have been found below.\n","the question: \n","do gun waiting periods effect suicide rates?\n","prediction answer: \n","No, there is no correlation between gun ownership and suicide rates in the United States. There is a correlation between suicide rates and gun ownership, but it is not a causal relationship. There are a number of factors that can affect suicide rates, but none of them are related to gun ownership. For example, gun ownership is not correlated with suicide rates.\n","golden answer: \n","That's probably because Congress does not allow for funding of research into pretty much anything related to gun violence. However, we can look at other countries to attempt to draw conclusions. In Australia, they've gotten rid of many guns and found that suicide rates plummeted: . The idea being that many suicides are 'spur of the moment' type things and that the presence of a very very easy method (via gun) allows them to occur. But, removing that method frequently allows the person's strong suicidal urge to 'pass'. A) this is an oversimplification, of course and B) you probably knew this part, thus why you asked. Assuming that interpretation is correct, then, in theory, a waiting period should have close to the same effect, assuming someone didn't buy the gun prior to their suicidal urge.\n","the question: \n","why is marilyn monroe considered such an iconic model?\n","prediction answer: \n","Marilyn Monroe is considered one of the most iconic models of the 20th century.

It was originally designed as a way for people to communicate with each other without having to be connected to a central server. It's still used today, but it's not as popular as it was in the early days of the internet.\n","golden answer: \n","Like reddit, just much older. Usenet is an ancient but great discussion board system. You have separate groups, dedicated to certain topics. There are many independent servers you can use. Servers usually have most of the common groups, i.e. they keep all the messages from these groups. To read, you pick any convenient server (e.g. in ancient days, one located nearby, e.g. at your university). Then you use a program like Thunderbird to download the messages and read them. Unlike a web forum, where all the icons, tables, HTML etc. have to be downloaded, you only transfer pure plain text messages. Since your client (Thunderbird) can download them, you can easily do it when you have internet, and then read (and reply!) while offline. Your messages go out to the world when you connect again. As soon as you send a message, your server will distribute it to other servers he knows (as long as they carry the group where you posted), which in turn will forward it to others. Today, your message usually reaches every common server within seconds. This way, it doesn't matter which server you use. It's great, but about 30 years old (possibly older than the WWW!) and has its issues (no upvotes/downvotes, for example). The decentralization (many servers) makes it hard to ban people without pre-moderating everything, so some groups have been overrun by trolls. Other than that, it is an amazing system, still preferred by many. Mozilla uses usenet for discussions about the browser, for example (they sync it to their mailing lists). The main downside is that you need a client instead of just visiting a web page, but once you get one, it is awesome. Some people discovered that you could also post non-text stuff (binaries), aka porn, movies and other pirated stuff, and have it distributed that way. Since this puts a lot of load on the servers, only special (usually paid) \"binary\" servers allow this. So basically, you have one usenet for discussions and one for piracy. For the latter, you use a special client that automatically finds the tens of thousands of messages into which your movie or other content was split, downloads them, joins them, and spits out a file. It's basically like megaupload, just that all servers exchange the content with each other. It has little to do with the original idea of usenet (sometimes even technically - some servers unpack the files for you, so it's basically a giant network drive full of warez).\n","the question: \n","how vital were belgium controlled rubber exports from congo in the early production of cars?\n","prediction answer: \n","Belgium controlled rubber exports from Congo in the early production of cars. The Congo was one of the first countries in the world to produce rubber, and it was the first country to export rubber to the rest of the world. This was a huge deal for the Belgian government, as it meant that they could control the flow of rubber from the Congo to Europe. It also meant that the Congo could be used as a source of raw materials for the development of the automobile industry.\n","golden answer: \n","That's a very good question. We do have to make a distinction between Congo under the rule of Leopold II and subsequently under the rule of the Belgian government, a transfer of power which occured in 1908. The Congo Free State existed between 1885 and 1908 and it was run like a private company focused on efficiency with no regard for human costs. The way Congo was run by the Belgian government after the reign of Leopold II was still very much troubled by systemic racism and colonialism, it was run more like an actual country in stark comparison with the Congo Free State. When the Belgian king Leopold II took control of Congo, he recruited a few experienced Belgian civil servants to help him build out the colony, but they were essentially there to enforce his will. The Force Public, which was the army through which Leopold II exerted control, had internationally recruited white people in positions of power while the lower ranks were locally recruited black people. The fact that Congo - a vast amount of land with rich resources - was under the control of Belgium, was not to the liking of many other European countries. It didn't help that Leopold II had made a lot of promises to neighbouring countries regarding the profits of his Congo project. Also, it's important to note that these were times when governmental control was still very much reserved for the elite. You have to keep in mind that universal male suffrage wasn't really all that widespread yet, certainly not in the United Kingdom where the governmental body was mostly made up of entrepreneurs or nobility. The same can be said for Belgium to some extent. While Belgium did have a long history of grassroots power structures, their version of universal male suffrage dbetween 1893 and 1918 was still plural voting. This meant that you gained extra votes for paying more taxes or having more money, up to a maximum of three votes. Before 1893 there was \"cijnskiesrecht\", which attributed votes only to those with a lot of capital. I'm certain that there's a name for it in English, but it's not my native language. So many political decisions were guided by the interests of these entrepreneurs who were a part of the governmental bodies for both Belgium and the United Kingdom. This is evident from the actions by Cecil Rhodes, a British entrepreneur who became the Prime Minister of the Cape Colony under Brittish rule. He pushed to take control of the southern regions of Congo to further his own interests. He wasn't the only British entrepreneur who took issue with the rubber coming from the Congo and the pressure from within the British government to overthrow Leopold his rule kept mounting. Leopold II viciously pushed his staff and the locals to offer rubber at dump prices on the international market. The Congo Free State was chronically understaffed and everyone involved was being pushed beyond the limits of what's possible and humane. While the humanitarian issues certainly played a big role in the downfall of Leopold II his Congo project, it was heavily influenced by his competitors within the British government. To answer your question, the rubber trade stemming from the Congo Free State was a major player on the rubber market. So much so that British entrepreneurs heavily pressed towards removing Leopold II from his Congo project and not just for humanitarian reasons. It's not a coincidence that the rubber trade from Malaya by British companies mostly took off shortly after Congo was transfered to the Belgian government. The reason as to why you can't find a lot of information on it is because there aren't too many sources on this. The Congo Free State was run like a private company during a time when international companies were absolutely lawless - unlike today *ahum*. There simply isn't a big paper trail. However, there's still a good amount of historical research on this specific question and I can certainly recommend you some. The only problem is that most of it is written in either Dutch or French and mostly behind paywalls for those who aren't affiliated with universities. So do you speak either of these language and do you have access to a university library? There are certain more popular books translated to English, but while they are certainly worth a read they aren't always as academically sound.\n","the question: \n","why would a lawyer ask a judge for permission to \"treat the witness as hostile\", and what are the benefits for being able to do so?\n","prediction answer: \n","In the US, a lawyer can ask a judge for permission to \"treat the witness as hostile\", and what are the benefits for being able to do so? First of all, it allows the lawyer to question the witness in a way that is not prejudicial to the defendant. For example, if the defendant is being questioned about whether or not he was involved in the murder of his wife, the lawyer may ask the judge to allow the defendant to be questioned about his involvement in that murder. The lawyer can also ask questions about the defendant's relationship with his wife. This allows the attorney to ask the defendant questions about his relationship with the wife, and the judge can decide whether the question is prejudicial or not.\n","golden answer: \n","At trial, there are two types of examinations: the direct examination (i.e. your opportunity to question the witness *you* call to the stand) and the cross examination (i.e. your opportunity to question to witness the other side calls). When examining your own witnesses, you are not allowed to ask what are called \"leading questions.\" Leading questions are questions where the answer is implied in the question (\"you're a redditor, correct?\"). Some judges will even consider any yes/no questions to be leading (\"were you on reddit last night?\") You *are* allowed to ask leading questions to 1) witnesses you are cross-examining; or 2) witnesses you are direct examining, but who the judge has declared hostile for some reason (e.g. you ask them their named and they say, \"f*ck off\" and everyone can tell it's going to be a struggle for you to ask them open questions) EDIT: or (in federal court and some state courts) 3) witnesses you are direct examining but who are either adverse parties or witnesses for the adverse party. EDIT: Wow, thank you guys so much for all the upvotes and for the gold! I'm glad I could be of help, and it's awesome to see so many people interested in the legal system. One more EDIT: As others have so nicely pointed out, I never really answered the initial question! Why would a lawyer want to declare the witness hostile? Let's start with why leading questions are typically not allowed on direct examination. In the american legal system, the goal of a trial is for the fact-finder (whether it be a jury or a judge in the case of a bench-trial) to determine the truth about what happened. The witnesses are called for their benefit. The goal of direct is for the witness to tell their side of the story (I'm using \"story\" loosely here, as it could also be an expert witness, etc.). The fact-finder will listen to determine 1) whether the content of the story is believable 2) whether the witness him/herself seems credible. Now consider, how can a fact-finder determine these two things when some slick lawyer is leading the witness into yes/no questions? At that point, it basically becomes the lawyer testifying, not the witness. However, when a witness has proven unable to tell their story, whether it be because communication is difficult for them (eg. they are a very young child, they have some sort of disability, etc.) or because they are simply acting hostile, the court will allow them to be questioned in the next best way which will still result in information being dispensed to the fact-finder so that they can do their job. This next best way would be through leading questions. So why would a lawyer want a witness to be declared hostile? The answer is so that they can ask them leading questions. The advantage of being able to ask leading questions, besides being able to move the trial along quickly (it might take hours for a young child to answer very basic non-leading questions) is that you can formulate the questions in a way such that you pretty much always get the answer you want and that you expect. Thus, the lawyer will be able to basically use the witness as a mouth-piece through which they can tell their clients' story exactly as they see fit.\n","the question: \n","lord palmerston quipped “the schleswig-holstein question is so complicated, only three men in europe have ever understood it. one was prince albert, who is dead. the second was a german professor who became mad. i am the third and i have forgotten all about it.” why was it irresolvable without war?\n","prediction answer: \n","The Schleswig-Holstein Question was the name given to the whole complex of diplomatic and other issues arising in the 19th century out of the relations of the two duchies (Schleswig and Holstein) to the Danish crown on one side and the German Confederation on the other. It was not resolved without war.\n","golden answer: \n","In case anyone gets confused about geography, Wikipedia has provided a nice annotated map of the area in question [here.] () This may prove useful to anyone who is not familiar with European geography. The Schleswig-Holstein question involves a number of things that we all love about 19th Century political history: problematic succession laws, the unification of nation states, and one Otto von Bismarck. In order to understand the question, we must travel many centuries back to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire. This is about a thousand years outside of my specialisation so I can't talk about it in great detail, but suffice to say that the area surrounding Schleswig and Holstein was an area of contention between the Danish and the Germans, and even before that had been contested by various groups. After the dust settled, all land north of the Eider river was held by the Danish, and all land south was held by the Germans. Holstein formed a part of the Duchy of Saxony. /u/wowbuggertheinfinite posted a more detailed overview lower down the comment chain here. Moving forward to 1326, King Valdemar of Denmark *allegedly* made a statement saying that the Duchy of South Jutland (Schleswig) and the Kingdom of Denmark should always remain two separate entities. Proof of this was first produced in 1448 by Christian I of Denmark, and in 1460 Denmark retook Holstein and Schleswig, which had been lost previously. The Treaty of Ribe added the County of Holstein as a possession of the King of Denmark, but not of the Kingdom itself. One phrase in the treaty, that Schleswig and Holstein should be 'forever inseparable', would prove important later. We can understand at this point why the issue becomes so complicated. The Danish Monarchy possessed the Kingdom of Denmark, and the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. However, neither Duchy was itself a component part of the Kingdom of Denmark, rather they were possessions of the *King* of Denmark. To make matters more complicated, in 1665 the Kingdom of Denmark introduced a succession law that allowed females to inherit. Schleswig and Holstein did not, and kept the Salic Law, where women were unable to inhereit. This will also prove important later. Over the years until 1806 there was a bit more back and forth between various Counts, Dukes and Kings with some territorial shifting, but nothing major. After the Holy Roman Empire was formally dissolved in 1806, Denmark extended their influence over Holstein, introducing various language and social reforms. However this was reversed by the Congress of Vienna, who included Holstein in the German Confederation. Given that the Treaty of Ribe had declared Schleswig and Holstein to be forever unseparable, this opened up a whole range of potential problems. With the stage set, we can now move forward to 1846. The male line of the Danish Monarchy is set to die out with the death of Frederick, son of King Christian VIII. Since the Kingdom of Denmark and the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have different succession laws, a crisis is brewing. 31% of the population of Denmark, mostly concentrated in the two Duchies, spoke German, and the rising star of Prussia offered hopes of a German unification. In 1848, tensions came to a head as Liberal revolutions broke out across Europe, and the attempts of the Danish monarchy to incorporate Schleswig-Holstein into the Kingdom of Denmark proper led to open rebellion. Prussian troops marched into Holstein in order to enforce their independence. The male heir to the Duchy, Christian August, duke of Augustenburg, was declared to be the legitimate ruler. However, Prussia here drew the ire of the other Great Powers of Europe, who up until now hadn't been particularly bothered by the constitutional history of a minor German Duchy. Britain and Russia wished to protect their naval interests and if Prussia could take the harbour at Kiel and build a canal to the North Sea then they had the potential to become a North Sea naval power, an outcome neither Britain nor Russia wanted. Austria were at this time in conflict with Prussia over which country would assume leadership of the German speaking peoples, and so tended to side against Prussia. While they were open to the idea of an independent Schleswig-Holstein, they were highly against idea that it could be integrated into Prussia. Additionally, the wishes of the significant Danish speaking minority in the Duchy had to be taken into account. Sweden sent troops to help Denmark, and Nicholas I of Russia diplomatically pressured the Prussians to withdraw. In 1850 the Treaty of Berlin re-established the status quo before the war, and in 1852 Christian August withdrew his claim. Over the course of the next decade, the Danish slowly tried to consolidate power in the Duchy. The teaching of German in Northern Schleswig was banned, and the teaching of Danish in the rest of Schleswig was emphasised. In 1855 the Danish proposed to create a national assembly, where the Kingdom would have 60% of the members, allowing them to outvote the Duchies. The Duchies naturally protested against this. The situation was rapidly becoming untenable. In 1862 the British tried to propose a new system, but were wary of upsetting the Prussians, with whom they had developed a tentative friendship. By 1864, the situation had changed. Russia was preoccupied with internal issues, Sweden had no real desire to intervene without the backing of other great powers, and Britain no longer desired to hinder Prussia quite so much. Denmark were issued an ultimatum by Prussia and Austria, the latter of whom had joined in an attempt to restrain Prussia. They rejected it, and lost the ensuing war quite badly. They later rejected an international conference set up to solve the dispute and lost the continuation of the war even more badly. Austria and Prussia agreed to split Schleswig between them, with Prussia administering Schleswig and the city of Kiel, and Austria administering Holstein minus Kiel. In 1866, Bismarck declared war on Austria and occupied Holstein. After a short 3 week war the fighting ended with no changes other than the transfer of Holstein to Prussia. The status of Schleswig-Holstein would stay the same until 1920, when a plebiscite saw the Danish speaking north assigned back to Denmark. In conclusion, the Schleswig-Holstein question was an incredibly complicated diplomatic and legal matter that came to a head in a period in which Prussia and Austria were looking to assert their superiority over German-speaking Europe. While war was certainly not inevitable, and the situation could have been solved diplomatically at several points, and attempts were made to do so, with Bismarck at the head of Prussia and German nationalism both in Prussia and Schleswig-Holstein at a fever pitch, it would have required supreme patience and diplomatic skill to do so.

It's done by using a laser to focus light onto a spot on the cornea. The goal of the laser is to bend the light so that it hits the right spot in the eye. The cornea is made up of a bunch of cells called rods and cones. Each rod and cone is responsible for a certain amount of light. When light hits a rod or cone, it changes the direction of the light. If the light hits the rod, it bends it, and if it hits a cone, the light bends the cone, and so on. This is called a refractive error. LASIK is done by putting a flap in front of the eye, so that the light from the laser can be focused onto the correct spot. The flap allows the laser to bend light into the right place, so it doesn't bend it too much. The downside to this is that it's very painful, and it can take a long time to heal. Wavefront/custom lasik is different from older versions of lasik because it uses a different type of laser, called an excimer laser. The excimer is used to guide the laser\n","golden answer: \n","It is better because it uses a superior system of measurement that takes more data into account. When your prescription is taken for standard LASIK/LASEK/PRK they are basically taking an average measurement for your entire eye. But of course your eye is not a perfect shape with a smooth surface. It's composed of organic tissues. Some of them are out of position, some of them are not as transparent as others, etc. etc. That's where Wavefront-Guided Custom LASIK/LASEK/PRK comes into play. The Wavefront technology takes measurements from many different angles (I believe I was told something like 240 measurements). This allows it to detect and adjust for tiny imperfections in parts of your eye, that could not be accounted for using traditional measurement technologies.

It's just that they've had to deal with it for a long time. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Alaska was one of the worst places in the world for Native Americans to live. It was the only place in the US where Native Americans were allowed to hunt, fish, and gather their own food. This meant that Native Americans had to spend a lot of time hunting, gathering, and gathering in order to get enough food to feed their families. As a result, many Native Americans suffered from depression and suicidal ideation. This was exacerbated by the fact that many of the Native Americans in Alaska were forced to live on reservations, where they had little to no access to food, and where they were often forced to work long hours for little pay. In addition, many of these Native Americans lived in poverty, which meant that they had to work hard to get by. This led to many of them becoming depressed and suicidal.

The purpose of these schools was to assimilate natives into European culture through constant immersion. That was accomplished through removing children from their homes and enrolling them in these schools at a young age. There was little to no tolerance for the speaking of languages other than those allowed and, very often, any remotely cultural behavior or sentiments shown by these children were punishable. From alumni testimonies that have come to light, the schools were rampant with physical, psychological, emotional and sexual abuses. The institutions are cited as a major force in the cultural genocide of First Nation peoples and the experiences there as one of the leading causes for the development of depression and other mental illnesses in Native peoples in the past.

They were a preceramic society, meaning that they were hunter-gatherers who lived in the arid valleys of the Andes. In order to preserve the bodies of their dead, they used a variety of methods. One of the most common methods was to place the bodies on reed litters, which were carried on reeds litters and consequently displayed. The mummies were elaborately decorated and colored (even later repainted) and are thought to be reinforced and stiffened in order to prevent the bodies from frightening the living. The decision of egalitarian preservation is proven in the mummification of the relatively less productive members of society (meaning those who could not contribute to the welfare of others; the elderly, children, infants and miscarried fetuses). It is often the case that the mummies may have served as a means of assisting the soul in surviving the desert. However, since the society is a nomadic one, as well as slightly nomadic, it is somewhat difficult to determine through archaeological records what led to the development of such practices, and what ended up\n","golden answer: \n","So contrary to Rothammer (as discussed in u/Dondville) Marquet et al argue that the Chinchorros lead a less hierarchical lifestyle and that mummification isn't tied to status. Mummification first started because of the pure heat of the environment. Natural mummification formed when bodies were left in dehydrated environments. This discovery of natural mummies is believed to be a primary inspiration for the creation of man-made mummies. The earliest man made mummies were most often covered with black mud after the removal (and replacement with natural fibres) of inards and sectioning, then rejoining of the body. The majority of early mummies were children, which lead Arriza to note a probable correlation between infant deaths and high arsenic levels in the local water (100 times the acceptable limit) and the EL Nino phenomenon. Mummification most likely started as a result of population rising (Marquet et al) and increased infant mortality. The common theory is that mummification was undertaken during periods of social stress caused by high infant mortality and a shortage of resources. Mummies were a tool to bring the community together, and perhaps played a religious, almost sacrificial role. Many of these mummies being children is probably those children who died from arsenic poisoning, which may have had importance. It actually dissapeared for a while (or at least wasn't as popular) only to be replaced with a different type of mummification (red mummies as opposed to the older black ones). When similar birth/death rates occured. Red mummies were prepared slightly differently (different coloured mud, and incisions made to extract innards rather than dissection). Red mummies again seem to be a reaction to envrionmental pressures and have been interpreted again as sacrificial.

First of all, it's important to keep in mind that many of these chapels were built in places that were not inhabited by the people who lived there at the time. For example, St. Augustine's Chapel in Rome was built in an area that was inhabited by people who had been living there for a long time. It was also built in a place where the people living there had been for a very long time, so it was a good place to build a chapel. Secondly, it was important to note that the location of a chapel was not always the same as the location where it was built. In the case of St. Benedict's Cathedral in Rome, for example, the church was originally built in the middle of the city, but was later moved to the side of the street, so that it could be seen from the street. The church was also moved to a different location in the city in order to make room for a new church. Thirdly, there were other reasons for a chapel to be built outside of an inhabited area, such as the need to provide a place for the monks to\n","golden answer: \n","Many times monasteries and churches were built on land which was donated to the church by a king; so it was a case of \"take what you get\". Also, a lot of monastic orders stressed avoidance of societal temptations in favor of a life of religious contemplation and work. Having your base of operations far from towns and cities would make this easier.\n","the question: \n","how accurate were medieval historians in terms of timeframes of the ancient world?\n","prediction answer: \n","Bede's *Historia Ecclesiastica* is one of the earliest sources on the history of the ancient world. It was written in the 11th century, so it's a good place to start if you want to get a sense of how accurate medieval historians were in terms of timeframes of the Ancient world.\n","golden answer: \n","Medieval scholars were well aware of chronology, since they had to calculate calendars so that they could accurately plot out the date of moveable Christian feast days like Easter (the subject was called computus). This science allowed them to produce tables which would show the date of Easter years in advance. The development of Easter tables was the principle factor leading to the redating of time to the birth of Christ (Anno Domini, “In the Year of Our Lord’s [Incarnation]”). This was first calculated by the monk Dionysius Exiguus (Dennis the Short) in the sixth century but not widely used until popularized by Bede (died 735), a scholar in Northern England who was both an expert in computus and widely read throughout the continent for his biblical commentaries and other religious works (though known today mostly for his History of the English Church). Prior to this dating of years was usually carried out according to the year of the emperor or of the indiction cycle (a cycle of 15 years). To the question about their knowledge of the past, they had access to a number of Roman and late antique histories of Rome. Perhaps the most popular in western Europe were Rufinus’s translation of Eusebius’s History of the Church, and, covering the earlier period, Orosius’s History against the Pagans (written after the sack of Rome to counter the pagan accusation that Rome suffered calamity because of punishment for abandoning the Roman gods and accepting Christianity). This history went back to the foundation of Rome and dated events according to how many years it happened from that founding date (which I think it set at 753 BC, though Orosius was writing before the use of AD and BC). There were plenty of other histories they also read, as well as chronicles, which listed all the important events that happened year by year. Of course they also used the Bible as a source of history and took great pains to correlate the events it describes with contemporary events in Greece and Rome. You can read more in The Oxford Companion to the Year by Blackburn and Holford-Stevens and in Faith Wallis’s book on Bede: The Reckoning of Time, and also in the primary sources like Bede’s History, Orosius, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and others.\n","the question: \n","what is the process of making propane gas and how is it possible to have a shortage of propane?\n","prediction answer: \n","The process of making propane is the same as making natural gas. It's just that natural gas has a much higher vapor pressure than propane, which makes it more difficult to get it to the right temperature and pressure to be used as a fuel. In addition, natural gas is much more expensive to produce, so it's cheaper to make propane.\n","golden answer: \n","Propane is a byproduct of natural gas production and oil refinement. It is present in oil and gas, but must be separated out. If found in crude oil, it is separated during the refinement process. If it is found in natural gas, then it is separated at the wellhead into what is commonly referred to as \"condensate\". Condensate is made up of several components, including propane, hexane, and butane. The condensate is then refined and the individual components are separated. It's possible to have a shortage of propane just like it's possible to have a shortage of any fuel; when supply and demand are out of sync. In this case, demand spiked because of extremely cold weather, creating a shortage and increasing price.\n","the question: \n","discrete cosine transforms\n","prediction answer: \n","Discrete cosine transforms are a form of lossy compression. They can be used to reduce the amount of data needed to compress an image. For example, if you want to compress a picture, you need to compress the image in such a way that it takes up less space on the screen than it would if it were uncompressed. In order to do this, you can use discrete cosine transform.\n","golden answer: \n","When you want to compress a series of data (say, a sound recording) you can look for patterns in the data, and just record the patterns instead of the original measurements. DCT describes data as the sum of a series of waves (cosine functions) vibrating at different frequencies. This turns out to be a great way to describe sounds using just a small set of numbers. So it's used in audio compression. It's also used in video compression, since pictures also tend to have patterns.\n","the question: \n","i've often heard jupiter referred to as a \"failed star.\" is this a fair representation? how close in terms of mass was it to actually becoming a star?\n","prediction answer: \n","Jupiter is not a \"failed star\" in the sense that it is no longer a star. It is a brown dwarf. A brown dwarf is a type of star that has lost enough of its mass to no longer be able to fuse hydrogen and helium to form a star, but still has enough mass to continue to exist as a red dwarf.\n","golden answer: \n","Not really. The minimum mass required to fuse hydrogen is about 80 times the mass of Jupiter, which is generally considered the lower bound of what a star is. For it to fuse deuterium, it has to be about 13 times the mass of Jupiter, and objects in this range are called brown dwarves. So, it's not like just a little bit more material would make Jupiter a star.\n","the question: \n","why is the beatles’ sergeant peppers considered such a turning point in the history of rock and roll, especially when revolver sounds more experimental and came earlier?\n","prediction answer: \n","Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is considered a turning point in the history of rock and roll, especially when it came out in 1966. It was the first rock album to incorporate psychedelic elements into the songwriting, and it was one of the first songs to incorporate the effects of LSD into the music. It's also the first song to use a synthesizer.\n","golden answer: \n","I feel like no-one has really answered your question so far, especially in regards to the Revolver part of the question. I'll try my best as a former Beatles fanatic. As you alluded to, Revolver was quite an experimental pop record, and it was the first album where the Beatles REALLY decided to use the studio as an instrument. The wild guitar solo in Taxman played the band's bassist, the backwards guitar in I'm Only Sleeping, the raga banger that is Love You To, and not to mention the psychedelic tape-looped masterpiece that is Tomorrow Never Knows. The Beatles threw brass and string instrumentation all on this thing as well, like in Eleanor Rigby and Got to Get You. Critics and Music Pundits understand the impact and importance Revolver brings forth, and many diehards will say Revolver is their favorite Beatles record. It certainly was mine for the longest time. Sgt. Pepper, however, was a different beast. In my opinion, it wasn't as musically ambitious as Revolver. However, conceptually, it changed how the artform of the album was seen. Instead of a collection of songs, it was better taken as a whole. All the songs are thematically and musically connected (The Beatles didn't exactly /intend/ this, but intention isn't important), the album art was wildly unique and fed into the album's themes. It was the first REAL album, Pet Sounds be damned (I like Pet Sounds more than any Beatles' album, so hush). This album also came out after the Beatles retired from touring, and after the double masterpiece whammy that was Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane. The hype was through the roof and the Beatles trumped even that. They also won AOTY at the Grammys, which was surreal. It's a landmark of an album. Revolver is fantastic, and I like it way more than Sgt. Peppers, but it isn't a landmark. Not like Peppers. EDIT: Umm, wow I was not expecting this sort of response! I wrote this up in about 5 minutes before I ran out to hang with friends, so I know it’s quick and dirty, lacking a ton of history of what lead up to Revolver/Sgt. Pepper’s. I just wanted shine light of that period, so it would easier to do future research! I did want to answer three questions I saw: > What do you mean “former Beatlemaniac”? I was OBSESSED with the Beatles years ago. They were all I listened to for years straight, and I pretty much read every single thing possible about them. Now, I’m way more chill, ha. Still love them to pieces. > You like Pet Sounds more than any Beatles album? Really? Yep. The compositions and arrangements of Pet Sounds are transcendent, and the performances of each song are perfect. It’s a flawless album that hasn’t been touched since IMO > Zappa did it first/did it better/The Beatles suck Zappa was a prolific avant-garde/experimental musician, and unlike the Beatles, he did not make music for popular consumption per se. He did not have the production/engineering chops of the Abbey Road team, and he did not prioritize making layered pop tunes. He made weird bops. He’s a great musician and composer, but he and The Beatles couldn’t be any more different. They affected very different circles.

If you mean \"how much of the information we read actually \"stays\" in our head\" then it depends on how you define \"in your head.\" For example, if you mean how much of what you read is stored in your brain, then it would depend on how long you've been on reddit and how much time you've spent on reddit.\n","golden answer: \n","In a simplified scheme of things, we could say that our memory comes in three parts. 1) Sensory Memory: 'Photographic' memory of the things we sense that persists for fleeting moments before being 'overwritten' by new information. This is why when you're not paying attention to the lecturer and they \"call you out on it\", you can often repeat what they had just said. You had an auditory sensory memory of the sounds that have recently struck your eardrum. 2) Working Memory. This is an expansion of our prior concepts of \"short-term memory\". It holds a few bits of information (often approximated to be 7 bits of information, plus or minus 2) and can access older memories to work with newer ones. This is what we use when actively cogitating. 3) Long-Term Memory. This is your essentially limitless storage facility, though it should in no way be thought of as a 'tape recorder' or other perfect recording device. This is where 'memorized' things go. So, you look at Reddit. What you see goes into your Sensory Memory. What you focus on enters your Working Memory as you read it and think about it. Now comes the tricky part--does it make it into Long-Term Memory, and thus become 'learned'? That depends. If it is a completely random fact, with no emotional or intellectual connection to you, that you don't actively try to remember, you will likely forget it. However, if you actively try to remember it (called \"Rehearsal\", takes place in your Working Memory), then you'll have a better likelihood of recall. The more Rehearsal, the better. If the information relates to a topic that interests you, if it strikes you as bizarre or amazing, if it effects you on an emotional level, you'll also be more likely to recall it. If you can relate it to yourself, you're more likely to recall the information (In accordance with the \"Self-Reference Effect\"). These special relationships that you might have with information help your brain to \"Encode\" the information on a 'deeper' level, forming more connections to other concepts and making recall an easier task. So, in short: it depends. It depends on the information and how it relates to you (or doesn't) and it depends on whether you put forth any effort to remember it. As far as brain development is concerned, I'm not fully sure what you're asking. If you do indeed learn any new information from your browsing (in accordance with above statements), then your brain structure does indeed change; this occurs every time we learn a new 'thing': our brains physically restructure.\n","the question: \n","why is the egyptian hieratic script not considered the world's first alphabet?\n","prediction answer: \n","Hieroglyphics is not considered the world's first alphabet because it was not invented by the Egyptians. It was developed independently of the other civilizations around the Mediterranean, which would mean that the Egyptians had developed writing independently of other civilizations in the Mediterranean. Demotic is considered the first alphabetic script because it is a mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Hieroglyphic and Demotic were primarily ideographic.\n","golden answer: \n","TLDR: No, hieratic is not an alphabetic writing system. **Egyptian hieroglyphs** Egyptian hieroglyphs can be divided into two types, phonetic signs and determinatives. Phonetic signs were used to write one consonant (uniliteral signs), two consonants (biliteral signs), or three consonants (triliteral signs). Phonetic signs could also function as logograms; the biliteral sign *pr*, for example, was used to write both the noun *pr* (\"house\") and the verb *pri* (\"come forth/out of\"). Note that Egyptians only wrote consonants; vowels were not recorded in hieroglyphs. Determinatives were signs at the end of words used for disambiguation. For an English example, adding vowels to \"ct\" could give you cat, cot, cut, cute, cote, acute, or various other words. If you wanted to signify \"cot,\" you might add a drawing of a piece of furniture at the end of the word. If you meant \"cat,\" you might add the paw print of an animal. There are many classes of determinatives (men, women, animals, furniture, pottery and vessels, earth, sky, and water symbols, etc.) used to disambiguate Egyptian words. Determinatives are quite helpful for Egyptologists because they enable them to guess the basic gist of a word even when its exact meaning is unknown (e.g. you can tell a word is the name of a type of clothing, even if its exact meaning is unclear). Hieroglyphic texts could be written right to left, left to right, or top to bottom. **Egyptian hieratic** Although hieroglyphs were very attractive when carved or painted onto stone, they were too cumbersome to use in daily life. Alongside hieroglyphs, therefore, the Egyptians developed hieratic. Hieratic signs are cursive forms of their hieroglyphic equivalents, often ligatured to allow the scribe to write quickly without lifting his brush. Originally hieratic signs were clearly recognizable from the hieroglyphic forms, and hieratic texts were written in columns. The Heqanakht letters are a good example. Hieratic signs became increasingly abbreviated over time, and during the Middle Kingdom hieratic texts switched from vertical columns to hieratic rows, as in P. Sallier II. P. Berlin 3022, which contains a copy of the Middle Kingdom *Tale of Sinuhe*, was transitional and includes both columns and rows. You can compare these examples of hieratic to the hieratic of the 20th Dynasty, which is noticeably different in style. Unlike hieroglyphic texts, hieratic texts were virtually always written right to left. You can think of hieratic as handwriting compared to typing something on a computer. In fact, it's quite common for Egyptologists to provide a hieroglyphic transcription while publishing a hieratic text. You can see the hieratic and hieroglyphic versions of a text side-by-side in this photo. Note that it's usually not too difficult to identify the hieroglyph a hieratic sign came from. Because it developed from the hieroglyphic writing system, hieratic contains all of its elements, including phonetic signs (uniliteral, biliteral, and triliteral signs) as well as determinatives. It is certainly *not* an alphabet or abjad. **From hieratic to Proto-Sinaitic** Keep in mind that the Proto-Sinaitic script borrowed **only** its signs from hieratic; the phonetic values assigned to the signs and how the signs worked are very different from Egyptian writing. The Proto-Sinaitic script used the acrophonic principle, in which a sign represents the first sound value in the word it represents. This was the innovation that marked the beginning of the development of the alphabet. For example, the Proto-Semitic word for house is *bayt-* (Akkadian *bītu-*), so the drawing of a house was used for the letter B (the \"-bet\" in \"alphabet\"). In Egyptian, however, the house hieroglyph has the biconsonantal reading *pr* (as in *pr-aA* or Pharaoh, literally \"great house\"). Moreover, unlike in Egyptian, there are no signs in the Proto-Sinaitic script that have biconsonantal or triconsonantal values. Each sign stands for only one consonant. **Further reading** I've assigned Andrew Robinson's *The Story of Writing: Alphabets, Hieroglyphs & Pictograms* as a textbook while teaching a course on ancient writing systems. It provides a very good, very readable overview of different writing systems and the evolution of the alphabet. The British Museum's *Reading the Past: Ancient Writing From Cuneiform to the Alphabet* is a compilation of short books (~60 pages each) covering cuneiform, hieroglyphs, Linear B, the early alphabet, Greek, and Etruscan. The same series has other books on on Chinese, Maya hieroglyphs, etc.\n","the question: \n","amazon vs hachette\n","prediction answer: \n","Amazon and Hachette are two of the largest book publishers in the world. They have a long history of competing with each other in the publishing industry. In the early days of the internet, Amazon was a major player in the book market. They would buy books from publishers and then sell them on their website for a fraction of the retail price. This allowed them to make a lot of money off of the books they sold. However, in the late 90s, Amazon decided that they wanted to make more money off the books that they sold, so they started charging a lot more than the publishers were willing to sell them for. This caused the publishers to stop selling their books on Amazon for a lot less than they were selling them for on their own website. This meant that they couldn't make as much money off their books as they had been making off of them. So, they decided to sue Amazon. The lawsuit was settled out of court, and both sides agreed to lower the price of their books to the full recommended retail price (RRP).\n","golden answer: \n","Nobody knows for sure, the details of the contract dispute are only known to Amazon and Hachette. The public comments both sides have made are most likely fairly biased towards their own side. However, Hachette is not some small publisher that Amazon is trampling over. They are owned by Lagardère Group, a company with 7 Billion Euros in annual revenue. As best I can determine, the root of the dispute is that Hachette wants to charge more for it's e-books. Amazon wants to charge less, generally preferring to keep e-book prices at 9.99 and under (cheaper ebooks helps Amazon sell Kindle devices and therefore more Amazon content). Hachette (and its authors) are portraying Amazon as a bully, using the size of its market to retaliate against them by not accepting pre-orders for books, etc. This may be true, but it seems like a pretty legitimate tactic. If you are in the middle of a tough negotiation with a supplier it seems reasonable to show them the consequences of not coming to mutually agreeable terms. Further, the authors themselves are the biggest victims, and under the royalty models that most publishers use the authors will lot lose/gain much due to a change in pricing. Hugh Howey, an independent author who has been very successful self-publishing with Amazon, and is generally disdainful of the traditional publishing model, has written quite a bit about it.\n","the question: \n","how did soviet occupation differ in germany, german allies, \"liberated\" countries, and territory annexed to the ussr, post world war 2?\n","prediction answer: \n","I can't speak to the Soviet occupation of Germany, but I can speak about the occupation of Poland. Poland was occupied by the Soviet Union as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which was an alliance between the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet Union occupied Poland from 1941-1944, with the exception of a brief period of occupation in 1944-1945, when the Polish government was overthrown and replaced by the Communist Party of Poland (PKK). The PKK was a puppet state of the USSR, and as such was not subject to the same laws as the other Warsaw Pact states. The Polish government, however, continued to function as a government-in-exile, and the PKK continued to operate as a political party. In the case of Poland, there was no real distinction between the Polish state and the Soviet state, as Poland was a member of both the PFLP and the CPSU (Communist Workers' Party). The Soviet state did not have the ability to declare war on Poland, and Poland was not invaded by the Soviets until 1944.

The Fatherland front was composed of Kimon Georgiev leader of Zveno(this is his 3rd coup d'état), BWP, BANU \"Pladne\", the Bulgarian Workers' Social Democratic Party (Wide Socialists). A new goverment was elected. Days after the the coup d'état the USSR would invade. Bulgaria falls under Soviet occupation until 1947. A series of People's courts were created where verdics would be handed out to \"fascists\". A lot of them were settling old scores and a lot of innocent people were killed. A lot of prisoners are released and are recruited into the forces of the communists. The military officers would be arrested and people would be incorporated into the army to make sure that the ideology of the army is a proper one (red). The leaders of the Fatherland Front army - NOVA would be incorporated into the army in order to prepare for the offensive against Germany.

They can be used in a variety of ways, and there is no reason to believe that they are inherently harmful. However, there are a number of potential health risks associated with the use of these materials. One of the most obvious is that they can act as a catalyst for other materials to react with them. For example, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been shown to be able to cross membrane barriers, which suggests that, under some conditions, they can cross membranes. This means that under certain conditions, especially those involving chronic exposure, CNT can pose a serious risk to human health. This limitation of human data is important to consider when trying to determine toxicity and the risk associated with these diverse and difficult to study materials. The data is still fragmentary and subject to criticism. Some studies have found some relationships between CNTs and MWCNT exposure, but each has considered a small sample size. Preliminary results highlight the difficulties in evaluating the toxicity of this heterogeneous material. Exposure studies have conducted over the past several years in order to determine where and how likely exposures will be.\n","golden answer: \n","Nanotechnology engineering graduate here. A recent [letter to the editor] () of Nature Nanotechnology says what I am going to reiterate and expand upon below. The biological effects of nanomaterials are at the moment impossible to summarize. The scope of current toxicity studies is both too narrow and too broad. Take carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for example. Before even starting a study we must ask \"What kind of CNT?\" (e.g. size, functionalization, dispersion medium, passivation layer). At the nano-scale, these details have an overwhelming influence on the biological properties of the material due to surface interactions. Even researchers studying the \"same\" material observe different biological outcomes due in part to differences in production methods and handling of the nanomaterials. There are no studies that cover all types of CNTs, and those that attempt to elucidate the effects of a few material characteristics are unable to create a clear picture since so much information is missing. Yes generalizations can be made, for example some coatings (e.g. PEG) prevent biological responses, and given a specific material it is possible to guess at the dangers of exposure. See [this] () review paper for a broad look at some of these generalizations. These are more concerns of the researcher or industrial worker exposed to the raw nanomaterial and at risk of inhalation. Consumers of finished products are at a low exposure risk since the nanomaterial is most commonly trapped in a solid matrix and most (not all) nanomaterials cannot penetrate the epidermis. But, the most pressing issue in nanotoxicology is not what researchers are doing, but that nanomaterials are controlled at the government level based on their bulk properties. Silver nanoparticles are categorized under bulk silver though their properties are very different. Look at your sunscreen bottle. It says titanium dioxide (TiO2) because the manufacturer is not required by law to state that it contains TiO2 *nanoparticles*. Consumers should not be worried about nanomaterials in medicine since these products undergo rigorous testing; however, cosmetics are uncontrolled and inexpensive to test and so are the most common use of nanomaterials today. If you look at the safety sheet for TiO2 nanoparticles it is very different depending on which company you buy it from because theoretically each company should conduct toxicity studies on their product, but they are not required to do so and so the information is listed as \"no data available\". As consumers we should be worried that the hazards are unknown, that the materials are in use long before toxicity studies are performed or their results even agreed upon by experts in the field, and that governments worldwide are only now making substantial efforts to regulate nanomaterials as separate from bulk materials. That being said, do not be afraid of nanotechnology. Most of the hazards you hear or read about in news sources, Wikipedia, yes definitely Reddit, etc., is misleading or just plain wrong. Read the articles yourself and even then be skeptical about the results and conclusions drawn by the authors. Those CNT-like-asbestos inhalation studies are not even relevant for human exposure risks. Most nanomaterial studies are not directly relevant unless you plan on injecting nanomaterials directly into your gut. **TLDR We cannot generalize yet. Nanomaterials have health risks just like other chemicals. Consumer products are mostly okay but be careful with cosmetics, they are not controlled. Also, for the love of all fish please don't wear socks with silver in them, it washes out.**\n","the question: \n","how can dell buy ems when ems is quoted at being worth twice as much as dell?\n","prediction answer: \n","ELI5: How can Dell buy EMC when EMC is quoted at being worth twice as much as Dell?

Windows is a set of programs that you can run on your computer. Each program has its own set of buttons, and each button can be set to a different color. When you click on a button, it sends a signal to the program that it wants to change the color of the window. If the program wants to make the window darker, it will tell the program to do so, and if it wants the window to be brighter, it'll tell it to make it brighter, and so on. If you click the right button, the program will send you a signal that says \"Make the window brighter\", and if the program doesn't want to do that, it won't send you the signal at all, and you'll see the window darken. This is the same thing that happens with transparency changing windows, except instead of changing the colors of the windows, it's changing the transparency of the program itself.\n","golden answer: \n","Liquid crystal displays— passing electricity can orient crystals in ways that let them pass light. When electricity isn’t applied, the crystals “relax” to a random state, blurring light as it passes. Other designs would have them totally shut out light. It’s VERY similar to how phone or computer screens work. Except for one particular type of screen (OLED), light isn’t produced as needed, where needed, in the colors needed. Instead light shines from the back of the screen, and LCD technology is used to block some colors and allow others through to create the right color/brightness when where it’s needed.

They can only raise the amount of money they have to pay for the food they need. If they want to raise food prices, they need to find a way to get the money they need from the people who need the food. If the government can't find the money, they can't raise the prices.\n","golden answer: \n","Have you ever made one mistake, found yourself in a bad situation, and instead of admitting you were wrong and undoing the first mistake, making a second, then a third, then a forth? The objective of the Venezuelan government was to help people. The country was awash in oil revenues, and so they decided to cap the cost of goods so that the poor could receive them for that low, low, price. The government made up the price difference with oil revenue. Basically you can sell a chicken (that costs a dollar) in a supermarket for a penny if the farmer gets a penny from the grocery store, and 99 cents from the government. When you do this however you cause three bad results. First you are creating the ability for people to live beyond their means. Why eat rice and beans if you can eat chicken and steak for the same price? Why eat leftovers if you can just buy fresh food each day? When you artificially lower the price for something demand for it goes up and you use more of it. Second if I can buy a chicken for a penny in Venezuela and sell it for a dollar in columbia there are going to be people who do just that, buying as many chickens as they can at the subsidized price and shipping them out of the country for a profit. And third, people are going to change how they live to fit their new budgets. If my grocery bill is normally 400 a month and suddenly it is $2.00 a month i have 398 dollars to spend on other things, so maybe I buy a new cell phone, gym memberships etc. On paper this looks like good economic growth but in reality suddenly a lot of people (Cell phone companies, gym's, and average people) NEED the subsidies to stay in place, and if they are withdrawn there would be a painful/messy reorganization. Now imagine this has gone on for years. You have gotten nothing but praise. The people love you, the media loves you, you have spent years telling yourself again and again how good what you are doing is for the people. And the people have gotten used to these low prices. People have gotten used to the extra money in their pocket. But now the... problems... with the system are starting to become clear to the government. They are seizing thousands of chickens every day at the border and know hundreds of thousands are probably getting through. The budget is very tight, even with the oil revenue we are spending more than we bring in. And then oil prices start to fall... How can we possibly admit that a system that seemed to work for years had been doomed from the begining? How can you admit the last years were all a lie? How can we admit that if we had just thought about things in advance this wouldn't be happening? How can we admit that people are going to have to give up their cell phones, their cars, all the benefits that we brought them for years because we were dumb? How can we tell thousands of people who have jobs selling cell phones and such that they are out of work? How could you have been so wrong when everything was going so right? Especially when we have another option... We blame the people exporting the goods. They were assholes to begin with. They knew the prices were lowered here to help the poor and they decided to profit from it. So we blame them. We start targeting \"hoarders\" we start rationing supplies so the smugglers can't buy thousands of chickens. Sure people are getting hungry... and here is the real evil of socialism... but our intent was to help them and once the current crisis is over it will all be worth it. And as oil falls further we just double down again and again. People are starving on the streets but still we believe our political and economic philosophy is the right one, for the people's own good, and so we let them die today to save them later.\n","the question: \n","why were many early movies westerns and why were other genres relatively slow to develop?\n","prediction answer: \n","I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. Westerns were very popular in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s. They were popular in Europe as well, but not as much as they were in the U.S. Because of this, there was a lot of money to be made in westerns, and they were popular with the general public. In the early days of the film industry, westerns were not as popular as they are today, but they were still very popular.\n","golden answer: \n","Oh man 1 i can actually answer for once!! So basically back in the 30s and 40s the Film Industry had a full monopoly and control over the whole visual entertainment, Since Television was not out till 1949. It was pretty normal for people to go out and see 5 to 7 movies a week at the time, so the Industry being a business first they found out that people liked certain genres more than others, this being Western, Musical, and Noir. Which such high demand for these films, the Industry would pump out hundreds of films a year for each genre. Now this did have draw backs at the time, since the Film Industry wanted to maximize profits, they didn't allow for director and writers to branch out and try new things in the business. Their ideals were make \" safe non offensive movies that everyone can recognize and want to see\", and since they controlled all aspects of the industry, the actors, writers, studios, directors, and even the cinema's and promotion were all employed by the industry majors. This business model basically killed off film as an art form and a form of expression for a few years, until Television hit the scene in the early 50s, suddenly cinemas lost a lot of profits fast, and with the nature of competition in a business, The film Industry had to now adapt since now their average 5 - 7 views per persons a week is no longer a thing. They let go of their tight grip on director, actors, and writers, anything to get people back on those seats. More R rated films came out and other genres like Sci-fy blew up. At the same time they started trying out gimmick like 3D glasses. Basically you can thank Television for saving film as an art form.

For example, when you speak English, your brain is used to thinking in English. When you speak a different language, you have to use different parts of your brain to think in that language. You can see this with fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). You can also see it with EEG (electroencephalogram).\n","golden answer: \n","So I assume you're asking if bilinguals' two languages are represented in distinct areas of the brain, and if bilingualism is associated with different brain areas that are active when switching from one language to another? Hernandez et al (2000) studied this with a single-language and dual-language picture naming taskusing behavioral measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants showed slower reaction times and increased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the mixed language condition relative to single language condition. There was no evidence that each language was represented in different areas of the brain. AKA language switching is a part of a general executive attentional system and languages are represented in overlapping areas of the brain. Furthermore, research (e.g. Wang et al, 2007) indicates that there are indeed neural correlates specifically associated with language switching, but that this seems to be direction dependent. Language switching elicits greater activation in the right superior prefrontal cortex, left middle and superior frontal cortex, and right middle cingulum and caudate. When the direction of switching is considered, forward switching (from native to secondary), but not backward switching (from secondary to native), activates several brain regions related to executive functions (i.e., bilateral frontal cortices and left ACC) relative to non-switching conditions. However we obviously can't garner what element of the switch is specifically responsible for this activation from this study in particular. TL;DR Yup. Language switching associated with executive function, neural correlates of each language are associated with overlapping areas of the brain and are switch-direction dependent.\n","the question: \n","for years nsa has raised concerns about the us power grid being hacked. what can the us do to protect the power grid? going green is critical for all, if nations are unable to protect their power grids, will that slow going green?\n","prediction answer: \n","There are a number of things that can be done to protect the power grid. One of the most important things is to make sure that the grid is secure. There are a lot of ways to do this, but one of the biggest ways is to ensure that there is no way for hackers to gain access to the grid. For example, if the grid was hacked, there would be no way to connect the grid to the rest of the world. If the grid were hacked, no one would be able to get to the other side of the planet. This is why it is so important to keep the grid secure. Another important thing to keep in mind is that the US is not the only country in the world that is going green. Many other countries are going green as well.\n","golden answer: \n","First, I think you're connecting two things that aren't connected. Going green, that is using more renewable energy sources, is not connected to the security of the electrical grid. Second, hardening the electrical grid against a cyberattack is an ongoing process.

The idea was that the slave states would get extra representation in Congress for their slaves, even though those states treated slaves purely as property. The clause provided a mathematical formula that allowed for the allocation of representatives in Congress that factored in the slave population. This representation is determined by every three out of five slaves are to be counted, or 3/5 of the total number of slaves.\n","golden answer: \n","It's important to note at the beginning that the \"3/5ths compromise\" came up in a debate about voting. The Slave states wanted slaves to count as whole \"people\" for the purposes of voting. This would mean they'd have more representatives and have more influence in presidential elections, because they'd be counting the slaves, who wouldn't be able to vote but would still \"count.\" The non-slave states didn't want slaves to count at all.

First of all, it's important to remember that the world was not settled west to east. It was settled east to west. There was a land bridge between Siberia and present-day Alaska, but there was no land bridge from Siberia to the Americas. The land bridge was exposed between 20,000 and 8,000 years ago, when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the Quaternary glaciation. There were several waves of migration from Siberia into the Americas by way of the Beringia land bridge. These people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. They migrated down the Pacific coast to South America. This time range is a hot source of debate and promises to continue as such for years to come.

Prior to the invention of mechanical clocks, the only way to keep track of time was by counting the number of hours in a day. This meant that if you wanted to know what time it was, you had to count the hours. If you needed to know when the sun was going to rise or set, you'd have to count how many hours it took for the sun to rise and set. The invention of clocks allowed people to track the passage of time without having to count hours.\n","golden answer: \n","Boorstin! Loved that book. James Burke (and others) tied the invention and widespread availability of clocks with work. There's a fun episode of *Connections* based around clocks. Some of the first clocks in Europe were used by monks who needed to keep track of times to pray. He rebuilds a water clock in that one based on a fragmentary 11th century manuscript found in a monastery in the Pyrenees. (It's around 16 minutes into that video.) It's designed to wake you up for nocturns, the prayers said in the middle of the night. Having a tool to wake you up means you don't have to wait for the sun any more. You don't have to (or, more darkly, aren't *able* to) sleep according to your body's needs. You can get up and do things. --- By the way, those monastic alarm clocks were only about as old as Su Song's clock tower, which was a bit more impressive as a construction - it was 40 feet tall and built of bronze between 1088 and 1094 CE. Unfortunately, it was disassembled by an invading army about a century later and carted off to Beijing, where no one could figure out how to put it back together again. Only recently, in the 1990s, were some folks able to follow Su Song's book on clocks, figure out the stuff he didn't include (to keep folks from copying his ideas) and rebuild the clock at Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science. Song based his design on earlier Chinese water clock designs, one of which used mercury (which wouldn't freeze in winter).\n","the question: \n","the difference between priest, pastor, vicar, minister, bishop etc.\n","prediction answer: \n","A priest is someone who is ordained to be a priest. A pastor is a person who is a pastor. A bishop is a bishop who is the head of a church. A deacon is a deacon who is an ordained member of the church, and a priest is a member of an order of priests.\n","golden answer: \n","It will depend on the religion and/or the denomination. As generically as possible: A **priest** is any person ordained by the religious authority to perform religious services. For example, all male members of the Catholic religious hierarchy are priests, whether they are \"simple\" priests or bishops or popes or what have you. In the following explanations I'm using the term \"priest\" generically, not in its more common technically Catholic sense. (One could also use the term \"cleric\" instead of \"priest.\") **Pastors** are typically low-rung priests, especially among Protestant denominations. A \"pastor\" is a \"shepherd\" of a congregation \"flock.\" Pastors are usually priests of smallish congregations. **Ministers** are also basically pastors, though among some Protestant denominations they can also be priests over larger communities. The term \"minister\" refers to the idea that this priest manages the religious affairs of congregation similar to the way a political minister manages the political affairs of his or her division/ministry. **Vicars** are essentially ministers as well, and are found especially within Catholicism. \"Vicar\" comes from the word that gives us \"vice-\" as in \"vice-admiral\" or \"vice president.\" So, someone who is in a high position of authority but not at the top. The Catholic Pope is the \"vicar of Christ\" - he's Jesus' deputy. Bishops are frequently associated with vicars who are priests slightly lower in the hierarchy than themselves. A **bishop** is a priest who has authority over multiple congregations, and usually authority over multiple priests (pastors, ministers, etc.). Bishops are found in some but not all Protestant denominations, and are typically associated with Catholicism. The term \"bishop\" is a rough translation of the Greek word \"episkopos\" which means \"overseer.\" So, a bishop is an overseer of other priests/congregations. Sometimes but not always a bishop will have his or her own congregation. Episcopalians (that is, U.S.-based Anglicans - Church of England - and note how the name comes from the same Greek word) use bishops as their main authority title. Within Catholicism, bishops are the heads of a \"diocese.\" An **archbishop** is an overseer of overseers, and is found primarily in Catholicism as the head of an \"archdiocese.\" Another related term that you didn't mention is **presbyter**. This comes from the Greek \"presbuteros\" and means \"elder.\" Some Protestant denominations (e.g., Presbyterians) have presbyters in bishop-like positions of authority. Catholic priests are technically presbyters, but this is not a common usage among most English-speaking Catholics. There are also **deacons**, who are typically lay religious authorities. What this means is that they're not ordained (they're not priests), but they still carry some responsibilities involved in running day-to-day operations within a church congregation. A **reverend** is a priest along the same lines as the pastor and the minister. Typically \"reverend\" is used as a naming title rather than as an actual title, so we have, for example, \"Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.\" - who was an ordained minister, and had a religious doctorate (I believe a Th.D. but I'm not certain). A **monk** is, within Catholicism (and some Protestant denominations, such as the Lutherans), a person (typically male, sometimes a priest) who does not have a congregation and is *typically* separated from general society within a monastery. Catholic monks are known as \"brothers.\" Historically, not all monks have been priests; I believe most are actually not ordained, and within Catholicism are not authorized to give communion for precisely that reason. **Nuns** are the female equivalent (and are definitely *not* priests within Catholicism because Catholic women cannot be ordained); they are called \"sisters.\" Catholic monks are not strictly speaking \"ordained\" but they are also not \"lay\" members of the religion. A **preacher** is someone whose priestly duties are understood primarily to be preaching-related (speaking in front of the congregation). \"Preacher\" is a term preferred by a lot of small, hierarchy-lite traditions/denominations as a way of distancing themselves from other terms that, to them, seem to be prideful. This is not, however, the exclusive use of the word. In all of this, though, bear in mind that each denomination is going to have its own quirks about nomenclature. And that these terms are *generally* not found outside of Christianity. So, for example, the primary term for a priest within Judaism is \"rabbi\", and within Islam a priest is an \"imam.\" These are terms that are *roughly* equivalent to pastor/minister within a Christian context, although they have different responsibilities and their positions within the overall hierarchy of the religious tradition may be different. This has been a broad overview and I am aware that some specific details are fudged for the sake of simplicity. Others are welcome to \"correct\" my explanation but bear in mind that this is eli5, not askscience.\n","the question: \n","why can't the police or banks trace the money, when people are scammed through irs or over the phone?\n","prediction answer: \n","It's not that they can't trace the money, it's that they don't have the resources to do so. If you're scammed through an irs or over the phone, you're not going to be able to track the money back to the person who scammed you. You're going to have to find a way to get your money back, and that's going to take a lot of time and money.\n","golden answer: \n","Ever played keep away? The person in the middle is wildly chasing the person that has the object, as the chaser get close the person throws the object to another. So the chaser has to go running towards the second person, and so on. Same thing with these scam artists, the money is quickly routed through various international banks all over the world. Sometimes in countries where the local cops have been bribed not to look, or are too poorly trained and under staffed to bother with a crime that happened abroad. Within a few hours or days of the con artists getting the money, it's been withdrawn and laundered. Think of a very simple example, I'm a friend of a friend who is crashing at your house after a crazy party. I'm someone your friend barely knows, and only recently met. While you're sleeping, I steal a $100 bill from your wallet. By some luck, you know that bill's serial number. In the morning, I leave early, go to a local shop, and change the $100 for 5x$20. Even if you manage to trace the $100 it's now been split up as $20s which will be harder to trace. Even if you manage to trace those $20s, I've gone somewhere else, bought something with the $20, or maybe bought prepaid gift cards with them. Add in, maybe I gave some of that money to another person. By the time you catch up with me, proving that I took your $100 will be difficult, and I probably don't even have the money anymore anyways. Same with these con artists, the person on the phone is \"just an employee\" of a larger criminal syndicate.\n","the question: \n","why is it that if it's on your wrist, it's a watch, but if it's on the wall, it's a clock? and why is it called a clock?\n","prediction answer: \n","The word clock comes from the Middle English clokke, Old North French cloque, or Middle Dutch clocke, all of which mean bell. The English word clock is derived from the Medieval Latin clocca, also meaning bell. In the Middle Ages, bells were used to mark the passage of time at sea and in abbeys. Monasteries broadcast important times and durations with bells, rung either by hand or by a mechanical device such as a falling weight or by rotating beater.\n","golden answer: \n","Second question first. Why is it called a \"clock\"? According to the Online Etymology Dictionary: > late 14c., *clokke*, originally \"clock with bells,\" probably from Middle Dutch *clocke* (Dutch *klok*) \"a clock,\" from Old North French *cloque* (Old French *cloke*, Modern French *cloche*), from Medieval Latin (7c.) *clocca* \"bell,\" probably from Celtic (compare Old Irish *clocc*, Welsh *cloch*, Manx *clagg* \"a bell\") and spread by Irish missionaries (unless the Celtic words are from Latin); ultimately of imitative origin. So the word \"clock\" appears to originate as being named after the bells that they rung. As for \"watch\", again from the Online Etymology Dictionary: > Military sense of \"military guard, sentinel\" is from late 14c. General sense of \"careful observation, watchfulness, vigilance\" is from late 14c.; *to keep watch* is from late 14c. Meaning \"period of time in which a division of a ship's crew remains on deck\" is from 1580s. The meaning \"small timepiece\" is from 1580s, developing from that of \"a clock to wake up sleepers\" (mid-15c.). So \"watch\" meaning \"timepiece\" seems to derive from using a small clock to wake soldiers up for their watch.\n","the question: \n","in case of a nuclear war what would bomber crews do after dropping their payload?\n","prediction answer: \n","In case of a nuclear war what would bomber crews do after dropping their payload?

The Arabic word 'hamas' (حماس) means \"courage or bravery\". The Hamas covenant interprets its name to mean \"strength and bravery\". Aims Hamas, as its name implies, aims to liberate Palestine from the Israeli occupation by resisting it. They believe in the principles of the Quran, the Sunnah (traditions of Prophet Muhammad), and the subordination of the world to the sovereignty of God. Their long term objectives are to restore the rights of the Palestinian people under the sacred Islamic teachings of the Holy Quran.\n","golden answer: \n","Hamas is an Islamic-fundamentalist political party that came into existence as a rival to the more secularized Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1987. At its inception Hamas was not militarized, and as a result they were allowed to organize without intervention from Israel because they were seen as an alternative to Yasser Arafat (the leader of the PLO). This ended in 1989 with Hamas' armed involvement in the First Intifada, which was a Palestinian uprising in response to Israeli occupation in the Palestinian Territories. Since that time, Hamas has engaged in many terrorist attacks on civilians in a response to the Israel's existence. They gained political power in 2007 from the Palestinian Parliament and currently control the Gaza portion of the Palestinian Territories. The short term objective is to gain control of the remaining West Bank and establish these territories as a recognized nation. The long term objective is to battle for control of all of current Israel. Currently, Europe, the U.S. and Israel consider Hamas to be a terrorist organization while most Arabic nations do not. This is very simplified, and I placed emphasis in some areas while not delving into particulars in others to paint the picture.\n","the question: \n","do all of the planets orbit on the same level, and if so why does it appear that we're \"looking up\" at saturn through earthbound telescopes?\n","prediction answer: \n","Yes, all of the planets orbit on the same level, and if so why does it appear that we're \"looking up\" at saturn through earthbound telescopes?

Saturn's rotational axis (and subsequently rings) is tilted 27 degrees relative to \"vertical\" for its orbit, much like Earth's rotational axis is tilted. This is in addition to the orbit being (barely) tilted relative to the ecliptic. Since Saturn's orbit takes roughly 29 years, there are long seasons of \"looking up\" and \"looking down\", and shorter \"edge-on\" seasons.

The Pilgrims did not leave for their own religious freedom, but for the freedom to not live among those who didn't believe as they did. They did not seek religious freedom because they did not want to live in a place where they could not worship as they wished.\n","golden answer: \n","Let me deal with the part about religious freedom here first. The claim you have heard is true. The Pilgrims at Plymouth and the Puritans who founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony wanted to practice their own faith. They did not support any wider concept of religious freedom. Other religious groups were barred from the colony and they had laws against blasphemy that were used to protect their version of theology Baptists were persecuted in the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the 1640s, and explictly banned by law in 1645. Punishments could be harsh. In 1651 for instance a group of three Baptists were arrested in Lynn, Massachusetts and convicted of re-baptizing adults (Baptists did this because they did not believe infant baptism was valid). All three were fined, one was whipped. Quaker fared worse than Baptists. In the 1650s Quakers who visited Massachusetts were branded, whipped or mutilated. Puritans who converted to Quakerism had their property seized. In 1659 and 1660 Massachusetts executed four Quakers; Marmaduke Stephenson, William Robinson, Mary Dyer, and William Leddra. The Puritans would have likely killed more Quakers, but they were commanded to stop by royal command in 1661. Puritans also tried to purge dissenting theology within their own ranks. Puritan Minister Roger Williams claimed that the Puritans had illegitimately occupied native lands, which resulted in him getting tried for sedition and heresy. He was banished from the colony in 1635 and ultimately founded what would become the Colony of Rhode Island. Rhode Island allowed for religious toleration. In 1638 the Puritans tried Anne Hutchinson in what is now called the Antinomian Controversy. The theology here is a bit complicated, but it resulted in the Massachusetts expelling Hutchinson and a number of other dissenters from their churches and banishing them from the colony. The Puritans were more repressive than England, but it was matter of degrees. In England it was not until the 1689 Toleration Act that dissenting Protestants, who were not members of the Church of England, could worship freely. This provided religious toleration to Baptist, Quakers and Puritans, but did not allow such freedom to Roman Catholics, atheists, or non-Christians. That said, how much repression dissenters actually faced in England could vary a lot, both Quakers and Baptists still spread widely during the seventeenth century. Quakers and Baptists were sometimes arrested, but they were not killed like they were in Puritan New England. The idea that society should tolerate of many religious views is a comparatively new one, it was only becoming common in Europe at the end of the seventeenth century. In the American colonies only Pennsylvania and Rhode Island would allow significant religious freedom for their residents. The Puritans were harsher than the England in enforcing their state religion, but both groups made religious dissent a crime.\n","the question: \n","; why did blackberries stop being popular?\n","prediction answer: \n","It's not that blackberries stopped being popular, it's that they stopped being profitable. In 2011, RIM reported that they had sold 6.8 million handsets, but was eclipsed by the sales of competitor Nokia's Lumia model for the first time. In 2012 RIM announced that the BlackBerry PIN would be replaced by users' BlackBerry ID starting in 2013 with the launch of the BlackBerry 10 platform. In 2013, BlackBerry announced that 4,500 full-time positions (4% of its operating staff) have been terminated and its product line has been reduced from six to four models.\n","golden answer: \n","Blackberry was focused on the business market. Originally it was only a business that could justify the expense of a smart phone so the apps were focused on the concerns of businesses.

Very successful. Blackberry stuck with the idea that there were going to be 2 markets, a business market and a general consumer market because business contract are very lucrative. The problem is that many business discovered that an Iphone more than met their needs and they switched. It's been very hard for Blackberry to switch gears and it's been a slow decline ever since.\n","the question: \n","the economics of c.h. douglas' theory of social credit\n","prediction answer: \n","The basic idea of Social Credit is that all citizens should be paid a dividend as capital and technology replace labour in production; this was especially attractive to farmers sinking under the weight of the Depression. The idea is that the government should be able to borrow money to pay for social programs, such as roads, schools, etc.\n","golden answer: \n","I've always struggled to understand social credit theory as well. Here in Alberta, Canada the social credit party formed the government for 34 years straight. They were a highly socially conservative christian party which left much of the social credit reforms unaddressed. For a time they issued \"prosperity credits\". These were essentially currency that decreased in value each week. They were designed to keep people from hoarding money during the great depression. They were extremely impractical at the time though and were barely used. The Socreds also tried to reform banking in the province, but I've never read how. It ultimately failed because a province doesn't have enough authority over banking practices to enact these changes. Ultimately, from my interpretation, think of socialism as government programs funded by taxes, and social credit as laws that see workers paid a a minimum wage that they can live and grow with. It's goal wasn't financial equality so much as it was a guaranteed minimum standard from which people can flourish. I could be wrong though, my understanding is limited to the historical sentiments of one (failed) case study. Probably not the best perpective. Hope it lends a bit of insight at least, I'm probably going to look up more now.\n","the question: \n","if the outer anatomy of your ear was removed leaving just a hole in the side of your head, how would your hearing be affected?\n","prediction answer: \n","Your hearing would be affected by the shape of your ear canal. The shape of the ear canal determines the shape and size of the inner ear. If you remove the outer ear canal, you will not be able to hear the sound coming from the other side of your head. However, you can still hear the sounds coming from other parts of your body.\n","golden answer: \n","Your pinna does a lot of things for your hearing. Perhaps most importantly, it subtle shapes the pressure waves that make up sound as they pass into your ear canal in different ways depending on the location of the sound. Determining left/right orientation of the source of a sound in complicated, but it involves timing and volume. It's something like stereoscopic vision, using your two ears to triangulate the location. Up/down orientation, as well as front/back is more difficult. To do that, your pinna shapes the sound coming into your ears, affecting the volume and the timbre. Timbre (pronounced \"TAM-bur\") is the \"quality\" of a sound not defined by the pitch or volume. Say, the difference between how a clarinet sounds and a trumpet sounds even when they're playing the same note. Over millions of years of evolution, our brains have learned to use that information to help locate the source of a sound. Over your lifetime, your own brain learns how to specifically use the modulation of sound from your unique pinnas. Relevant Smarter Every Day. As a result, it would be much more difficult for you to locate the direction of the source of a sound. Other animals solve the problem with different ways. For instance, dogs will cock their head to the side, changing the angle that their ears make with the sound to get a better read on it. Owls' ears are offset - one is higher than the other - and they have radar-dish like structures to funnel the sound into their ears. Your pinna has another purpose, though. It resonates roughly at the same pitch as normal human speech. Likewise, your ear canal and the bones in your ear also resonate at roughly human speech frequencies. We're *really good* at listening to other humans talking (which should come at no surprise, given the amount of brain space we dedicate to understanding language). With just an ear hole you would expect to have a little more difficulty understanding other people talking, especially with a lot of other noise.\n","the question: \n","what kinds of things could i expect to find in a cabinet of curiosities?\n","prediction answer: \n","Cabinets of curiosities were very common in the Middle Ages. The most famous example of a cabinet is the *Dell'Historia Naturale* (Naples 1599) (illustration, left). It serves to authenticate its author's credibility as a source of natural history information, in which many volumes are stored lying down and stacked, in the medieval fashion, or with their spines upward, to protect the pages from dust. Natural history specimens of Carniolan and foreign plants, a smaller number of animal specimens, a natural history and medical library, and an anatomical theatre. The catalog of Worm's collection, published as the Museum Wormianum (1655), used the collection of artifacts as a starting point for Worm's speculations on philosophy, science, natural history, and more. In addition to the most famous and best documented cabinets of rulers and aristocrats, members of the merchant class and early practitioners of science in Europe formed collections that were precursors to museums. Many monarchs, particularly in particular, developed large collections of objects. Some of the objects included as belonging to natural history (sometimes faked), archaeology, ethnography, religious or historical relics, works of art (including paintings), and antiquities.\n","golden answer: \n","We can take a look at one of the most famous cabinets of curiosities: that of Ole Worm, in Denmark about the time you're mentioning. Here is a woodcut of the inside of his cabinet. As we can see, the cabinet contains a wide variety of items, from natural phenomena such as taxidermized animals and fossils to artifacts from faraway countries and ancient peoples (mostly from the New World in his case, so a lot of Native American stuff). In the beginning, the majority of the cabinet would likely have been natural phenomena, such as shells, taxidermied animals, bones, horns, and fossils. The earliest depiction of such a cabinet can be seen here. and we can see that it is heavily reliant on natural phenomena. Later versions of the cabinet might include works of art as well as the aforementioned natural phenomena and artifacts. Here is a later 17th century painting of part of a cabinet which depicts a lot of art as well as shells and ancient coins. One thing that you might find in a *Künstkammer* would be a \"thunderstone\". These were flint points (Paleolithic tools such as arrowheads, spear points, or axes), but people of the time believed they were embedded in the ground by lightning and had magical properties. It was actually the collection of these \"thunderstones\" and the comparison of them to tools brought to a *Künstkammer* from the New World that enlightened scholars as to their actual use as tools by very ancient people.\n","the question: \n","were \"greasers\" anything like the gangs of today, or was it just a fashion fad?\n","prediction answer: \n","Greasers were not like the gangs of today, or was it just a fashion fad? The term \"greaser\" was applied to members of the subculture because of their characteristic greased-back hair. It was not used in writing to refer to the American subculture of the mid-20th century until the mid 1960s, though in this sense it still evoked a pejorative connotation and a relation to machine work. Greasers were often associated with and assumed by the mainstream public to be members of street gangs (often ethnic-based gangs) or motorcycle gangs. Their choice in clothing was largely drawn from a common understanding of the empowering aesthetic of working-class attire, rather than cohesive association with similarly dressed individuals.\n","golden answer: \n","They were not organized gangs in the way we use the term today. Greaser was more of a label that was used in the same way that hipster is used today, a categorization coined by outsiders. It is my understanding that greasers did not refer to themselves as such. Modern gangs like the Bloods and the Aryan Brotherhood display a pretty rigid hierarchy, are often national and even international, and usually assemble in the first place to engage in some sort of illicit activity. The Hell's Angels, for example, started as a M.C., but evolved into a bonafide syndicate with specific \"business goals\". That's not to say that greasers didn't engage in certain illegal activities, but it was not necessarily an implicit goal in the way it is within modern organized gangs. Just because you looked like a greaser, didn't mean you were in an organized gang. Yet I wouldn't really say that the greaser thing was merely a fashion statement, either. They were in many ways the American equivalent to British rockers: kids from working-class families that sort of stayed within their social group, and adopted a certain look. *West Side Story*, *The Outsiders*, etc. sort of created this image around the way these kids dressed. *West Side Story* in particular creates a real Hollywood caricature, it's not going for historical accuracy or really any sort of commentary on what was really a more complex social identity. Greasers and rockers were originally just poor kids who really couldn't afford nice clothing, so they'd wear their work clothes all the time. Tank tops and tee shirts weren't considered appropriate clothing to wear in public, but they were perfectly fine for factories, auto shops, etc. Denim was cheap and utilitarian, and the now-iconic cuffed jeans started because these guys usually had to buy pants that were a few sizes too large, or had belonged to their older brother, etc. It was certainly an image that evolved over time, with both greasers and rockers wearing this \"uniform\" with a certain degree of pride (suspenders were also big among rockers) as time went on, sometimes to explicitly identify with a group. Rockers and greasers are also often associated with motorcycles and that culture, and this too stems from bikes being cheap, available, and easy to maintain, as odds were at least one guy in the group worked as a mechanic, or was at least mechanically-inclined, something you just didn't see as much within groups of clean-cut teenagers from wealthier backgrounds. Same goes for getting away with smoking and drinking. And I guess fighting in public if you had to look out for your friends. Asserting yourself within a group has always meant something different for every social class around the world. TL;DR: Not like the organized gangs of today, but not merely a fashion statement, although the look became iconic. Rooted in working class culture and developed from there. **EDIT** Got my wires crossed. Suspenders were more of a skinhead thing. Also an interesting counterculture. If you're interested in this stuff, there's lots of great stuff out there on greasers, rockers, mods, skinheads...sixties youth counterculture in general is pretty fascinating.

The electron was first discovered in 1891 by George Johnstone Stoney. He called the particles \"corpuscles\", but later scientists preferred the name electron which had been suggested by Georg Heinrich Hertz in 1897, prior to Thomson's actual discovery. Thomson discovered the electron by observing the magnetic deflection of cathode rays. He concluded that the rays were composed of very light, negatively charged particles which were a universal building block of atoms. He found that whatever the material of the anode and the gas in the jar was more than 1,000 times smaller than an atom, suggesting the subatomic particle now known as electron.\n","golden answer: \n","The electron was discovered with a cathode ray tube, which is an evacuated chamber that carries a light emitting beam when a voltage is applied to it (used for old TVs and monitors). If you put a magnet near the tube, the beam deflects from a straight path, in the same way that a wire with electricity running through it is attracted or repelled by a magnet. Using basic physics, one can calculate parameters of the beam by the way it bends. For example, if the particles composing the beam are very heavy, they will not bend as strongly. What JJ Thompson showed was that the particles in the beam had to be of an extremely small mass, much smaller than even than lightest known atom (Hydrogen), indicating a new particle.\n","the question: \n","did ferdinand marcos, from the philippines, forged an attack in manila to justify martial law?\n","prediction answer: \n","I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. Martial Law (1972-1991) In 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines in a state of Martial Law because of the student demonstrations and law officers were becoming too unruly and uncontrollable. He declared Martial Law in order to put the country back to normal. He did this by declaring martial law in all areas of the country, including the city of Manila, which was the capital of the Philippines at the time. The reason he did this was because he believed that there was a threat to the country posed by the communist revolution in China. He believed that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was trying to overthrow the government through a revolution in the Philippines, and that the communists were using the Philippines as a staging ground for their revolution. He also believed that if the CCP was successful in overthrowing the government, it would lead to the rise of the Communist Party of the United States (CPCUS), which would then be able to take over the Philippines. The CCPUS was the largest communist party in the world at that time, and the CCPUS had been fighting the US for a long time. So, when Marcos declared martial law, he was\n","golden answer: \n","The **Martial Law Era** of **Former President Ferdinand Marcos** is a complex period in our history. Different kinds of people had different kinds of experiences. Those who *took up arms against the state, or were sympathetic to them*, naturally had different narratives compared to those who *lived through the period as* *compliant, obedient citizens*. And in between are others who had different stories to tell, some positive, some negative, and many others that are mixed. Of course, each side had reasons to stay in theirs, and many, were due to *political beliefs*. Communism in the Philippines has failed (Had he succeeded in his younger years, **Jose Maria Sison** would have established something similar to what the Kim family did with North Korea because *he believed that* he was the **Filipino Mao Zedong**), but they're trying to actively forward their political agenda on two frontlines: the legal front (the National Democratic Front), and its armed insurgent wing, (the New People's Army). The legal front is mostly dependent on exploiting the people by introducing such concepts to them, most popular is their *hiding behind* ***student activism and activism in general,*** which gave both a bad name and a reputation for being defenders of the communists, and the traitorous sympathisers of the Huks (which is true, for most part now, in modern times). Some were latecomers, and the rest were the originally persuaded by the beliefs. Many of them didn't believe that communism was the answer to the problems plaguing the Philippines (for the rich, it was obvious why, but for the ones who managed to honestly uplift their socio-economic standing, it was ridiculous, because a lot of them were also people who weren't helped and people who led hard lives, but learned to be dependent on themselves without having to rely on the government too much), and neither was armed struggle, even more. Many had simply done their best in different fields the way the South Koreans did when they experienced their hardships. For students, it was different. Many of them genuinely were sympathisers for the exploited, but for the others, it was different. For all its fearful reputation even at that time, the \\[Communist\\] Party \\[of the Philippines\\] was merely a ragtag band of hubristic fantasists who thought replicating the Chinese revolution was a cinch. I can conclude that he definitely wasn't the one behind the Plaza Miranda Incident, or the bombings that followed afterwards. The Plaza Miranda Incident, was confirmed by one of the Party's Founding Fathers, Ruben Guevarra, the Head of the CPP Military Commission and a member of the CPP Central Committee, circa late 60s all the way to the 70s, to have been perpetrated by the Communist Party's very own Dante Cordero, acting with others in the series of bombings, but starting with the Plaza Miranda Incident, otherwise known as Operation Plan Big Leap Forward, the first in a series of campaigns that the CPP launched against the government.

These proteins act as a scaffold for the microtubules that make up the cell. There are a lot of different types of proteins involved in making these proteins, but they all work in the same way: they bind to each other and form a ring of 13 protofilaments called a myotube. Each of these myotubes is made of a different type of protein called a microtubule. Each type of myotubule has a different set of proteins that bind to it. Some of these proteins bind to other proteins in the cell, and some of them bind to proteins in other cells, and so on and so forth. There's a lot more to it than that, but that's the gist of it.\n","golden answer: \n","Here is an article on microtubule organization in plants. A bit of background - the MTOC, or microtubule organizing center, is exactly what it says. In cells that contain centrioles, they are the MTOC. In cells that don't contain centrioles, such as higher plants, the nuclear envelope often serves as the MTOC. So what the above article explains is that there are certain \"microtubule-associated proteins,\" namely MAP65, katanin p60, and MOR1, that are largely responsible for organization and assembly of microtubules in plants. Another big question regarding lack of centrioles is how plant cells divide. In animals, the mitotic spindle attaches to the centrioles/centrosomes. In plants, the mitotic spindle attaches to microtubule arrays at cortical MTOCs. Here is a perspective from Plant Cell about microtubule arrays and here is a paper about plant cell division if you want to read further.\n","the question: \n","does parental blood type influence miscarriage or development?\n","prediction answer: \n","There is no evidence to suggest that parental blood type has any effect on fetal development. However, there is some evidence that maternal blood type can influence fetal blood type. For example, if a mother has type O blood and a child has type B blood, the child will have a higher chance of being born with hemolytic disease than if the mother has ABO blood and the child has Rh blood. This is because ABO and Rh blood have different antigens on their surface. This means that the mother's antibodies will bind to the fetal red blood cells (RBCs) and cause their destruction (hemolysis). This is a major cause of HDN, because 75% of pregnancies result in some contact between fetal and maternal blood\n","golden answer: \n","The most common example of this is Rh Incompatibility where an Rh- woman is impregnated by an Rh+ man. If the fetal blood is Rh+, it can immunize the woman who considers this a foreign antigen. When the maternal anti-Rh antibodies cross the placenta, they can lyse fetal blood cells leading to complications including fetal death. At birth, this is called hemolytic disease of the newborn. Accumulation of heme degradation products (bilirubin) can swamp the fetus or newborn's ability to further metabolize these toxic intermediary compounds. Since the blood brain barrier is not yet well-formed, high bilirubin levels can cause brain damage leading to later developmental abnormalities. This process is known as kernicterus. Often, maternal Rh exposure occurs at birth, meaning that the first child is born unaffected. Subsequent pregnancies begin with the mother already immunized resulting in miscarriages unless the fetus also happens to be Rh-. To prevent this, pregnant Rh- women are treated with anti-Rh antibodies that will bind and destroy Rh+ cells before they are recognized by her immune system. See: Very rarely, more minor antigen incompatibility can cause a similar scenario.\n","the question: \n","how did it come to be that we say \"speak now, or forever hold your peace\" at weddings? was there a time where objections were common?\n","prediction answer: \n","I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can tell you that there was a time where objections were common. In the Middle Ages, there were a lot of people who didn't like the idea of marrying someone they didn't know, so they would say \"speak now, or forever hold your peace\" at weddings.\n","golden answer: \n","Two issues are involved here: First, the medieval church’s regulation of the degrees of [consanguinity] () and [affinity] ( within which people could not marry. Second, the shift in the 12th century to a “consent theory” of marriage by which a couple married each other by exchanging “words of the present [tense]” (*verba de praesenti*)—“I take you to be my husband/wife”—regardless of whether witnesses or a priest was present to bless the marriage. If they exchanged vows this way without witnesses or a priest, the marriage was said to be “clandestine” (secret). It was legal (i.e., a valid, binding sacrament) though not licit (i.e., allowed). The problem was that a man (or I guess sometimes a woman) could seduce a maiden into a clandestine marriage, sleep with her, and then deny that there had been any exchange of vows. He might even already have been married. To combat both clandestine marriages and people marrying within forbidden degrees of relationship the [4th Lateran Council of 1215] () ordered (in Canon 51) this: > [W]e absolutely forbid clandestine marriages; and we forbid also that a priest presume to witness such. Wherefore, extending to other localities generally the particular custom that prevails in some, we decree that when marriages are to be contracted they must be announced publicly in the churches by the priests during a suitable and fixed time, so that if legitimate impediments exist, they may be made known. In England, this public announcement was called “banns.” Priests were obliged to announce an upcoming marriage three Sundays in a row to allow anyone who knew of impediments to the marriage (clandestine marriage, couples related within forbidden degrees, bigamy) to come forward to “speak now or forever hold your peace.” Source: I’m assuming you can find details in Jacqueline Murray’s *Love, Marriage, and Family in the Middle Ages: A Reader* (2001) or Frances & Joseph Gies’ *Marriage and the Family in the Middle Ages* (1989).

If you put a ball of gas with that sort of mass together, you're going to be able to make it stable at more than 1 to 1.5 or so times Jupiter's mass because it won't be in hydrodynamic equilibrium - its gas pressure will be too small to counteract its own gravity, and the gas will collapse until those two balance each other out.\n","the question: \n","on earth you can reach a stable temperature about 20m underground (i think), would it work the same as on mars?\n","prediction answer: \n","Yes, it would work the same as on Mars.

You can't compare the score on one course to the score on a different course, so you can't just sum up or average a golfer's round scores - a 72 at one course is awesome, but at an easier course, 72 might be considered a horrible score. So they came up with the FedEx cup. The FedEx cup is a points-based system. The PGA decides a total number of points available for each tournament, which can vary from tournament to tournament. Golfers are awarded points based on their finish position in the tournament. Towards the end of the year, the points leaders are invited into a series of playoff events, finishing with the \"Tour Championship\" tournament. The winner of that tournament gets the FedEx cup for the next year. Prior to the FedEx cup, the PGA had zillions of different standings listings - and nobody could decide which was more important... there was the \"money leader\" list, which tracked the amount of money a golfer won in a year (until 2013 this was a qualifier for getting a Tour Card; in 2013, it converts to FedEx cup points). They have lists of how many tournaments a golfer has won, how many majors they have won, and all kinds of other lists. The FedEx cup was a response to all these lists, giving fans an easy, points-based system to follow. The schedule starts in January in Hawaii, runs through the west coast through the winter, through the south and east in the spring and early summer, and heads to the north and midwest in the summer. The season ends in Late September with the Tour Championship. *whew*... anything else? :)\n","the question: \n","what is the likelihood of a major food crisis? how can we stop it?\n","prediction answer: \n","I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. There are a number of factors that could cause a major food crisis. The first is the depletion of oil and natural gas reserves. The second is the increase in population. The third is climate change. The fourth is the availability of food.\n","golden answer: \n","Due to the oil intensive nature of modern agriculture, major food crisis will likely be precipitated by significant disruptions to oil markets and supplies, i.e. trouble with Iran and the Straight of Hormuz. Modern agriculture is increasingly consolidated into the hands of fewer and larger companies. Really the only way to avoid large scale food crisis is to promote decentralization of food production such that a significant portion of food production is shifted into ones own backyard or neighboring small farms. This will mitigate the oil reliance and the risk of putting too many eggs in the mega farm basket. TL:DR-Grow a garden.\n","the question: \n","what happens to human cardiac muscle as you do cardio exercises? does the heart micro-tear like skeletal muscle?\n","prediction answer: \n","The heart does not micro-tear like skeletal muscle. The heart is made up of two chambers, the left and right ventricles. The left ventricle is larger than the right, so the heart has to pump more blood through the body to counteract the oxygen deficit building in the skeletal muscles. When you do cardio exercises, the heart pumps more blood to compensate for the lack of oxygen in the muscles. This increases the volume of the heart, which causes it to enlarge. This enlargement is called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and it is the cause of sudden cardiac death during or shortly after a workout.\n","golden answer: \n","Left ventricular hypertrophy which is the growth of the left ventricle can happen from having a very trained body as well. Many pro cyclists and endurance athletes have this, it reduces work capacity due to the hearts overall efficiency. A reason why endurance athletes have crazy low heart rates, the heart is just that efficient at pumping blood. Now cardiomyopathy and left ventricular hypertrophy can also happen from years of steroid use coupled with heavy lifting, this is a permanent condition that compromises the overall function of the heart. Your ejection fraction which is the pumping ability essentially decreases, thus compromising your heart and essentially being a cause of death sometimes. This can also happen to obese especially those prone to it genetically, but more common in steroid users. Since all steroids essentially cause an erythropeitic response in the blood, which is a signaling of red blood cell production from the kidneys, causing blood to get thicker. This definitely plays a role in the pressure it adds to the arterial lining from elevated blood pressure. Some guys take such high doses for so many years that the androgens cause the heart to grow in itself on top of blood pressure issues. An athletic ventricle hypertrophy is different because the changes are not permanent to the heart and often reverses once the athlete starts training. This is kind of the gist of it, I'm starting to rant I guess. Hopefully someone much smarter can chime in. Cheers!\n","the question: \n","francis ii abdicated as holy roman emperor, ending the hre. he did so after his defeat at the hands of napoleon, but why exactly?\n","prediction answer: \n","Francis II abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor, ending the HRE. He did so after his defeat at the hands of Napoleon in 1806, but why exactly? The short answer is that he did not want Napoleon to succeed him as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He wanted to be Emperor of Austria, a title that had been given to him by the French Emperor Napoleon III in 1804, and that he had been granted by the Emperor of Prussia, Frederick Augustus, in 1805. However, when Napoleon advanced as far as Thuringia after September 1806 in response to the Berlin Ultimatum, which demanded the withdrawal of French troops from the left bank of the Rhine, Frederick August joined with Prussia. This meant that Frederick Augustus could no longer claim the title of Emperor of Germany, and Frederick Augustus was forced to abdicate in 1807. This led to the creation of the Kingdom of Hanover, which was ruled by George III of the United Kingdom until Queen Victoria's accession in 1901.\n","golden answer: \n","Francis II dissolved the Holy Roman Empire only a few days after the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine by Napoleon, and the announcement from many of the smaller German states that they were leaving the Holy Roman Empire in favour of the Confederation of the Rhine. Napoleon had actually issued an ultimatum demanding that Francis step down, and while that was definitely a factor, there were other reasons for the fall of the Holy Roman Empire. With the utter humiliation of Austria by Napoleon, and the organization of the Confederation of the Rhine by Napoleon many of the Smaller German states left the Holy Roman Empire. With the rise of Prussia, Germany had really been split into three spheres of influence, Prussia, Austria, and the rest of Germany. Many of the smaller German states threw their lot in with Napoleon and joined the Confederation of the Rhine for numerous reasons, one they feared Napoleon and his armies, secondly they figured that by accepting Napoleon's protection in the Confederation they might better position themselves for the future with or without Napoleon; basically they hoped build themselves up and prepare for the future. Finally, the reason many of the smaller German states joined the Holy Roman Empire and still participated was because it provided protection from bigger states, Austria had basically made the title of Holy Roman Emperor into a hereditary title, so any member of the Holy Roman Empire was basically guaranteed the protection (in theory anyways) of Austria. Napoleon showed that the protection offered by the Holy Roman Empire was not clearly all it was cracked up to be. Furthermore, after the treaty of Luneville states in the Empire and outside began to just annex the various small German states. Austria, Prussia, France, Bavaria, Baden, Wurrtemburg all gained substantial territory, many of the smaller German states were wiped of the map. It really undermined the structure of the Empire that member states and the leader of the Empire could just at any moment rearrange the territory of the Empire. Beyond that though, the Holy Roman Empire had simply just become stagnant, the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 that ended the Thirty Years War took away the ability of the Emperor to decide on religious matters in Germany which was a major part of the original structure of the Empire. There had been attempts to reform the Empire since around 1790, specifically with regards to secularization and federation. This had promoted some, such as Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg, to think the Reich was collapsing and thus they tried to save it. Dalberg was a high ranking official in the Holy Roman Empire and was the head of one of the Archbishopric states (small little religious states that were in the Empire). Basically he saw that no one in the Empire, including the Emperor had the will to actually go through with the reforms, so he turned to Napoleon to save the Empire, by offering members of Napoleon's family high ranking offices in the Empire. Napoleon wanted none of this, he had seen the issues that being Emperor had caused Austria, and he preferred to keep his little system of Client States intact rather going and getting involved in the decaying Empire. Napoleon planned to just let the Empire die off. Dalberg ended up jumping ship and joining the Confederation of the Rhine, seeing it as the successor to the Holy Roman Empire. He tried to do what he had tried to do in the Holy Roman Empire and reform the Confederation of the Rhine, but everyone kinda just ignored him. The German princes who were leaving the Empire said that > They had effectively been abandoned by both major German powers; ‘in vain’, they declared, ‘did one look for Germany in the heart of the German polity’; those whose lands lay nearest to France had had no choice but to seek peace with France; now they were all resolved to seek the protection of the Emperor of France.\" In the closing days of the Reich there was some attempt to mould it to fit the new political situation. Bavaria proposed that the Empire turn into a permanent German federal state of sorts, with a figurehead Emperor chosen by election, the Reichstag would be transformed into a permanent body of representatives. Prussia tried to build their own quasi Empire in the North of Germany, both suggestions didn't pan out. There were reports from Austrian officials saying that the Holy Roman Empire had served its purpose and was no longer worth maintaining in the face of French pressure. For example one was released by an Austrian politician and official in the Holy Roman Empire named Joseph Hass: > Foreign power and politics’ had now achieved what the unruly spirit of the German princes and their mistaken sense of freedom had failed to do over centuries: the unity of the German Reich was destroyed. ‘The German people no longer constitute a state’, he wrote, ‘not because of the desire for independence of its Estates, but rather in order to impose a foreign yoke all the more rigorously.’ Virtually nothing was left of the system of the Reich; the emperor now only had authority in the Archchancellor’s lands, in Western Pomerania, Mecklenburg, and the Hanseatic Cities—‘for as long as these lands retain their present rulers’. Francis decided to relinquish the Crown and end the Empire, but only after making sure that he was confirmed as the hereditary Emperor of Austria and all the lands that went with it. Francis didn't reference the French ultimatum, simply saying that he had tried to fulfill his duties as Emperor. He stated that since he had lost the confidence of the Electors and Princes he would abdicate and release all servants of the Reich from their duties. He said: > ‘for as long as we can live up to the confidence placed in us by the Electors, princes and Estates and other members of the Reich, and for as long as we are able to satisfy the obligations we have assumed’. > we hereby decree that we regard the bond which until now tied us to the state of the Reich as dissolved’. In the mind of Francis, it was better to end the Empire and confirm his own power as Emperor of Austria, than risk the Empire falling into the hands of Napoleon, or one of the Electors. An Empire dominated by Napoleon was an Empire Francis did not want to be apart of. My main source for this would be volume II of the book \"Germany and the Holy Roman Empire\" by Joachim Whaley. But the book is very long and isn't the most riveting read, so if you're looking for something to read on the matter, I'd advise looking for the book \"The Holy Roman Empire 1495-1806\" by Peter H. Wilson\n","the question: \n","why if at all are tanning beds more dangerous than sunbathing outside when it comes to skin cancer?\n","prediction answer: \n","Tanning beds are more dangerous than sunbathing outside when it comes to skin cancer. Sunbathing exposes your skin to a lot more UV radiation than tanning beds do. This means that you are more likely to get skin cancer if you tan in a tanning bed than you are if you sunbathe outside.\n","golden answer: \n","If you spend 30 seconds googling it the top result from The Mayo Clinic: Are tanning beds safer than natural sunlight? Answer from Lawrence E. Gibson, M.D. Tanning beds don't offer a safe alternative to natural sunlight. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation damages your skin, whether the exposure comes from tanning beds or natural sunlight. This damage increases the risk of skin cancer and premature skin aging. In fact, most tanning beds emit mainly UVA rays — which may increase the risk of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. If you'd like the golden glow of a tan without exposure to damaging UV radiation, consider using a sunless tanning product. Avoid tanning beds, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen whenever you're outdoors.\n","the question: \n","did the hanging gardens of babylon actually exist, and has definitive proof been found? why is it the only wonder whose location has not been definitely found?\n","prediction answer: \n","The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are listed by classical Greek writers as one of the Seven Wonders of the World – places to see before you die. However, there is no evidence that they actually existed, and it is possible that they may have been purely legendary. There are a number of theories about the location of the Garden of Eden, but none of them have been proven to be true.\n","golden answer: \n","Yes, the current consensus is that the Hanging Gardens existed. Or, we know at least that the Assyrian kings did build extravagant gardens and could devise very elaborate, technologically advanced watering systems, as described by Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, and Philo of Byzantium. But, the classical and cuneiform sources provide many different, sometimes conflicting, details about the existence of various royal gardens. I'm personally a bit dubious whether there ever existed the ONE Hanging Gardens of Babylon: the classical literary traditions might be a conflation of a number of different stories about royal gardens in the East. But, Stephanie Dalley, a now retired assyriologist from Oxford University who has written a book and various articles about the Gardens, has come up with a nice theory for the location of the Gardens that does reconcile the classical tradition somewhat with the archaeological evidence - although her theory does (and probably will) remain unproven. Dalley thinks the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were located at the Palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh. Her reason for thinking that the Gardens never actually existed at Babylon is that many generally reliable classical authors, who describe Babylon to some length and who should be interested in exactly this sort of marvels, such as Herodotus (I.181), Xenophon (in *Cyropaedia*), or Pliny the Elder (*Nat. Hist.* VI. 123) never mention any gardens - even though they do describe the magnificent walls of the city. And, even more seriously, archaeological finds or cuneiform sources in Babylon give no signs of the Gardens. Notably, king Nebuchadnezzar, to whom the wonder was attributed by classical authors, says nothing about any gardens in the abundant inscriptions that record his building-works in the city. The famous classical descriptions of the gardens, from which we know them, come from: 1. Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC), an engineer who wrote technical treatises, described the watering system of the gardens to some length; but we do not know what is his source. 2. Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC, 10.1-6) quoting Ctesias of Cnidus, a c. 400 BC historian of Persia and Assyria; Ctesius’ works are lost but he’s generally considered a somewhat unreliable source. 3. The geographer Strabo (1st century AD, XVI 1.5), who according to his own words based his account of Persia in e.g. written eyewitness stories of the officers of Alexander the Great. It’s not clear who is his source for the Garden of Babylon. 4. The Jewish author Josephus (1st century AD, *Contr. Apion.* I 19-20; *Antiquities of the Jews* X 11.1), saying that he has based his knowledge on Berossus, a Babylonian priest who apparently wrote history in Greek in 3rd century BC; Josephus’ account is thus often considered the most legit 5. Quintus Curtius Rufus (1st century AD, *History of Alexander* V 1.35), who’s description of the garden is thought to rely on Clitarchus, a late 4th century BC historian who compiled his own *History of Alexander* from contemporary eye-witness sources. There is an extremely handy website that has collected together all the classical sources in English translation. So, the thing to note here is that none of these people writing about the Garden of ’Babylon’ had ever visited Babylon, not to mention Persia, expect perhaps Philo, of whose life we know nothing. And, they’re writing about the old history and geography of a distant region, the languages of which they could not themselves speak; it’s a game of Chinese whispers in Greek, Aramaic, Old Persian, and cuneiform… Classical authors regularly conflate or are mislead by their indigenous sources and get details about both the Persian past and present wrong. For example, Josephus attributed the Gardens to Nebuchadnezzar, but he was also the most famous ancient Mesopotamian king known in classical antiquity who just becomes a short-hand for ”famous Eastern king who did lots of stuff”: quite a number of things that he never historically did get attributed to him in classical tradition. The Greeks also understood the history of Mesopotamia within a faulty framework of three successive monarchies, Assyria, Media, and Persia, completely omitting the Neo-Babylonian kingdom (which Nebuchadnezzar ruled), so they often keep getting names and successive rules of Eastern monarchs wrong. The Greek and Jewish tradition weren’t very good at keeping track of names of Eastern cities: they specifically mix up Nineveh and Babylon, something that also happens in the Biblical texts (e.g. II Chronicles 33:11 says that Assyrians took Manasseh captive to Babylon, which was at the time a ruin; it ought to say Nineveh). So, it’s not difficult to accept that the classical tradition just got the location of the Gardens wrong. Dalley then further goes onto identify Nineveh as the location of the Gardens and the king of Assyria Sennacherib (705 BC to 681 BC) as their builder. One of the main reasons for this is that Sennacherib describes at length in his records that he commissioned engineering works to bring mountain water to Nineveh, in order to provide water for drinking and for a garden that he had built. There’s also an architectural relief in Nineveh by Sennacherib’s grandson Assurbanibal, which shows a lavish garden: picture of the sculpture, and here’s a drawingwhere it’s a bit easier to see what’s going on. Sennacherib's garden has for long been considered as a sort of ’proto-type’ of the Hanging Gardens, but Dalley thinks we should in fact consider them as *the* Hanging Gardens. We should note that the Greek description for ’hanging’ gardens does not imply the same as the English, i.e. plants with their roots higher than the actual leaves and top. A close reading of the sources could indeed support a garden like the one described in the sculpture relief: a naturalistic landscape rising up in tiers \"like a (Greek) theatre\" (Diodorus Siculus): forest trees are planted in it in terraced levels, and water is brought into the garden along an aqueduct which is incorporated into the terracing. There’s also a decorative pavilion or small palace in the relief, which might correspond to the \"royal lodges of every description\" which Diodorus mentioned. The only issue is that there’s no devices of raising water in huge quantities to the garden, just how ”streams of water emerging from elevated sources flow partly in a straight line down sloping channels” (Philo). But, the relief is broken in the middle, and it’s possible that the picture did show some water-raising device, too. So, here’s artist Terry Ball’s picture of the ’Hanging Gardens of Babylon’ based on Dalley’s instructions and the Nineveh relief. Dalley further backs up her argument by noting that Sennacherib conquered and destroyed Babylon to shambles during his rule, rendering the city completely deserted for some seven years; so, technically he was the ’king of Babylon’. And, Dalley thinks there might be some evidence that during this time Nineveh as Sennacherib’s capital was considered as ’New Babylon’, further explaining the later confusion. This is possible, but all this is bit shaky proof for Nineveh as the definite location for the Gardens. The Nineveh theory is mainly based on that sculptural relief, and it’s easy to make the literary descriptions and the very scarce historical evidence we have to fit the picture when we want to make it happen, considering how much room for speculation there is. Her theory is lovely and certainly works, but we should note that there were other lavish gardens in Mesopotamia that might have just as well been the source of the classical tradition; the kings quite liked bragging about gardens and engineering works in public inscriptions. For example, the banquet stela of Assurnasirpal II from Nimrud described his engineering works that brought mountain water to his garden at Nimrud, and the huge party he held when the work was completed, entertaining more than 69,000 people with extravaganza. TL;DR: Some gardens definitely did exist in Mesopotamia; to what extent they were THE Gardens of Babylon, is open to interpretation.

At the end of the First Confederate Congress, it controlled just over a half of its congressional districts, while Federals occupied two-fifths and almost one-tenth were disrupted by military conflict.\n","golden answer: \n","I am a Texas Historian, and I think I can offer some information on this. Vicksburg was indeed a major defeat for the Confederacy, but the Union did not hold the entire Mississippi afterwards. The Confederacy still held the lower portions of the Mississippi, but they could no longer use the upper portions of the river for transportation or communications. So, if you can envision the Southern states, there was still a narrow opening below Vicksburg and the gulf. In Texas, after Vicksburg, communication with Richmond was hard to come by. The state government was basically defending itself, and was relying on the combined Confederate forces of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. In late 1863, the Union launched a major two pronged invasion of Texas commanded by General Banks. The intention of these campaigns was to: 1) Completely sever the Confederate overland cotton trade into Mexico. 2) Seize and capture the Texas coastline, including its coastal defense systems, and reduce the amount of blockade runners. 2,000 Union soldiers came ashore at the mouth of the Rio Grande and separated into two columns. The first movement of troops started up the river and eventually made it all the way up to Laredo before a Confederate garrison, under the command of an Hispanic officer, halted their advance in an astonishing victory. The second, and more successful column of Union soldiers, began moving up the Texas coastline towards Galveston. These troops were able to seize all of the Barrier Islands, the majority of the port cities (Corpus Christi, Indianola, Port Lavaca, etc.), and all of the Confederate fortifications from the mouth of the Rio Grande to the tip of Matagorda Island. So what does all this rambling have to do with your original post? The Union invasion of Texas, which lasted from 1863-1864, generated a massive scare with-in the western portions of the Confederacy. When the Federals began their campaigns in Texas, the Rebel leaders of the western Confederacy panicked. Separated from the majority of the South, with an extremely low number of soldiers (most of whom were already losing hope for a Southern victory), the commanding officers had to go as far as calling up all of the local militias and volunteer units to aid in the defense of the state. By the Spring of 1864, there were almost a 1,000 Union soldiers ready to make an attack against either Galveston or Houston. But, for some untold reason, Banks suddenly decided to cancel the movement and ordered a campaign to seize control of the Red River in Louisiana. It would prove to be a major mistake. The Red River Campaign of 1864, was aimed at furthering the rift with-in the Confederacy. The Union had finally seized control of New Orleans, and Banks foolishly believed that northern Louisiana and eastern Texas were mostly devoid of Confederate forces. His error in judgement led to the Federal defeat at the Battle of Sabine Crossroads, which altered the entirety of the campaign, and re-fueled the Confederate morale. If you want to find primary documentation on just how scattered and panicked the Confederate forces in the west were after Vicksburg, I highly suggest researching the Texas campaigns of 1863-64. Probably one of the best books on the subject is titled “The Yankee Invasion of Texas”. I can’t recall the name of the author, but I know you can find it on Amazon for about 20 bucks.

The idea is that the government should be able to bail out any bank that fails because they are too big to fail on their own. If they fail, they will be bailed out by the government, and the government will be responsible for the cost of the bailout.\n","golden answer: \n","A lot of the biggest banks in the US (i.e. JP Morgan / Citigroup are probably the classic cases) are financial conglomerates that house many different kinds of businesses that touch many different (and arguably unrelated) areas of finance. They might have a division that does personal banking (bank accounts for people + credit cards), a division that does commercial/corporate banking (lending to businesses and corporations), and a division that does investment banking (trading and advisory work). The idea of \"too big to fail\" is that these conglomerates touch so much of the economy, that if one division has a problem that might make the bank go insolvent (i.e. huge trading losses), the government basically *has* to bail them out, since the repercussions of failure are so big. What Sanders and others who want to \"break up\" these big banks want to do is basically split them into smaller entities that don't touch so many sectors of finance at once. The most commonly talked about split is to separate the investment bank (trading and advisory) from the personal banking and commercial/corporate banking divisions.\n","the question: \n","i am about to read animal farm for the first time - what should i know before i begin?\n","prediction answer: \n","If you're going to read Animal Farm for the first time, you might want to read the introduction by Crick.

The movie is worth checking out after the book, and I think you'll enjoy how different this adaption is compared to the book and you can easily see that the film, like the book, became a vehicle for anti-communist propaganda following WW2. First, Orwell published his novella just days after the end of World War 2, and initially, his political slant and anti-Stalinist views made it difficult for him to find a publisher. Remember that USSR had been a valuable ally for both the Americans and Brits, so it was unthinkable that such a scathing but disguised criticism of Stalin would be well-received by the public. The book I referenced is *Orwell Subverted: The CIA and the Filming of Animal Farm* by Daniel Leab. In it, Leab talks about how Stalin was loved by the public, to the point of the average citizens at the time referring to him as \"Uncle Joe.\" Despite this as you know, *Animal Farm* received favorable reviews and enormous commercial success in both the US and Britain and not because readers somehow missed its obvious references to the USSR. Despite Orwell's focus on Stalin, it's likely that the book was intended to be an attack on totalitarianism as a whole. In his essay, \"Why I Write\", Orwell briefly mentions *Animal Farm* as \"the first book in which I tried... to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole.\" Orwell's personal political leaning towards socialism and \"his contempt for what he called 'the ordinary stupid capitalists'\" (Leab) suggests his criticism intended to target the tendency for any utopian movement to extinguish any notion of individuality. Consequently, while the novel is undoubtedly anti-Stalinist, Orwell’s work is underlined by his socialist stance and does not condemn communism. When the novel finally attracted the CIA's attention, they omitted the inconvenient aspects of Orwell’s criticisms and rewrote numerous parts of the source material to create the script for the 1954 animated film version of Animal Farm. I won't spoil it for you, but I do recommend that you check out the 1954 film after you read the book. The tone completely changes, and it makes for an interesting, if not enjoyable, watch.\n","the question: \n","does the ice sheet of antarctica have a \"bottle cap effect\" on the recently discovered volcanoes underneath?\n","prediction answer: \n","No, the ice sheet does not have a \"bottle cap effect\" on the recently discovered volcanoes underneath.

The ice sheet is responsible for the vast majority of glacial ice in the world, and it is believed to be responsible for about 70% of the world's fresh water.

In a normal cell, protein homeostasis (proteostasis) must be maintained because proteins are the main functional units of the cell. If these structures are altered, critical processes could be affected, leading to cell damage or death. Heat shock proteins help prevent protein aggregation that can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, or Parkinson's Disease.\n","golden answer: \n","So heat shock proteins are a group of proteins. They are regulated by transcription factors called Heat Shock Factors. During cell stress, this family of proteins is made to help the cell cope with the stress. So these proteins normally \"chaperone\" other proteins by helping them fold correctly. Proteins have different structures they fold on top of themselves and heat shock proteins make sure that they fold right. They also act in the immune system as antigen presenters, so they can kind of hold out \"bad\" bacterial or viral proteins to immune cells and say \"hey, kill this thing\". :)\n","the question: \n","why are absorption lines not lines?\n","prediction answer: \n","The absorption line is a combination of all of the emitted radiation, not a single frequency (i.e., it has a nonzero linewidth). In addition, its center may be shifted from its nominal central wavelength. In liquids, the absorption lines are sometimes reduced by a process called motional narrowing. This term is used especially for solids, where surfaces, grain boundaries, and stoichiometry variations can create a variety of absorption lines.\n","golden answer: \n","There are many different sources of line broadening. The must fundamental limit is lifetime broadening: since an atom does not remain arbitrarily long in an excited state, the uncertainty principle, or if you prefer the Fourier relationship, guarantees that the line will have a finite width. Otherwise, any interaction may cause an increase in line width of the order of the transition frequency associated with the interaction. Examples for this are dipolar broadening, unresolved fine structure (Lamb shift and such), hyperfine structure, etc. You are also correct in that Doppler broadening can be important. Very stable transitions are actually hard to get and a lot of effort is expended into having as sharp as possible transitions for use in atomic clocks or laser systems. The eigenvalues of a composite quantum system are not \"supposed to be\" a single exact frequency.

The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (Lithuania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Greece) and the Soviet Union (Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus) were all opposed to the idea of a federation of Central and Eastern European countries, based on a Polish-Ukrainian axis. The Soviet Union and the Leningrad Conference (1919) were also opposed to it, as were the Czechoslovakian and Slovak governments. However, there was some support for the idea outside of Poland, especially among the Baltic and Balkan states.\n","golden answer: \n","Even within Poland a lot of people disagreed with it. Pilsudski's plan relied on many, many countries coming together to coordinate. Here was the problem. Pilsudski pissed off Lithuania when he waltzed into Vilnus/Wilno and claimed it for Poland (as it as his hometown). Ukraine was in a civil war, and they were suspicious of the idea as it was likely to result in Polish hegemony, like under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Ditto with Belarus. Latvia and Estonia had little interest in falling under a Polish hegemony. Germany and France were extremely suspicious of Pilsudski, and would likely have frustrated his attempts to create this federation. The Soviets also opposed it and actively sought to frustrate his attempts. Lastly, a large chunk of Poland opposed it, preferring instead to occupy territories that were historically Polish or could be easily Polonized.

In fact, quantum mechanics is one of the most widely accepted theories of the universe. However, Laplace did not believe in quantum mechanics. He believed in causal determinism, which is the idea that the past is the cause of the present, and the future is the effect of the past.\n","golden answer: \n","Quantum mechanics lacks^1 determinism, therefore the Laplace Demon would only be aware of statistical aggregate behavior and would not be able to predict the future to arbitrary precision. ^1 Some interpretations keep the concept, but generally it's always much more restrictive than classical determinism. Most people just drop the concept entirely and accept true random physics.\n","the question: \n","if earth was the size of jupiter, would we have explored the entire planet by now?\n","prediction answer: \n","If we were the size of Jupiter, we would have explored the entire planet by now. Jupiter is much larger than Earth and considerably less dense: its volume is that of about 1,321 Earths, but it is only 318 times as massive. This means that we would be able to see the entire surface of the planet.\n","golden answer: \n","Assuming you've accounted for all the other variables (gravity, etc.) that an 'inflated' Earth would bring, let's look at the math! Jupiter's surface area is over 120 times that of Earth. So this brings another assumption into play: The distribution of land masses. Again we'll ASSUME that we don't just copy-paste our land masses and ocean onto a Jupiter sized globe. Because if we did, an ocean that size (473,280 km between France and Canada!) would have prevented the discovery of the New World and changed the resource and technology curve quite a bit. Instead let's say there's new continents at reasonable intervals, with a 71% water coverage. The means the discovery of new continents will be available, and technology can progress at roughly the same rate. Now that we've covered THAT, we can fast forward. There would likely have been no circumnavigation of the world until the era of long distance flight. On old boats, it would have taken well over 10 years if they managed to live off seafood and rain water somehow. And it would have taken hundreds of years to establish outposts or supplies, do the cartography, establish seasonal prevailing currents, etc. And circumnavigation just means ONE ROUTE, not mapping the hundreds of possible land masses from pole to pole. The 1900's would have pounded out a good chunk of the 120X sized globe with aerial circumnavigation, but space flight would have been the real nail in the coffin. A view of the globe from space would have shown all of the nooks and crannies that needed to be looked at, and directed our explorers to the right places. By now, they would have 'caught up' to our level of exploration. So how long would it take to travel around that planet? In a modern sailboat, based on Jessica Watson's circumnavigation of 210 days, it would take 2,520 days or 6.9 YEARS to sail around the Jupiter-Earth. Based on jet flight, an SR-71 Blackbird slowing for in-flight refueling regularly would take around 6 days at cruising speed. Based on space flight, it would take around 20 hours to orbit at the level that Vostok 1 accomplished it. In other words: Good luck. :) Edit 1: Gah, brainfart on circumnavigation figures, thanks for everyone pointing that out! Divide by 10, add 'about', kazam! In the sailing cases, we're talking very rough estimates anyway, since we don't really know how many times they would get lucky with Austrailias, or unlucky with north/south America without a Panama canal. :)\n","the question: \n","who did, and who did not, hitler gas exactly?\n","prediction answer: \n","Hitler gas was used in a variety of ways. It was used as a gas mask, as an insecticide, as a poison gas, and as a chemical weapon. There were a number of different types of gas used by the Nazis. The most common type of gas was the Zyklon B gas, which was used by both the SS and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union used it in their gas chambers, and the Germans used it on the Eastern Front. The Germans used the gas on the Western Front, and it was used on both sides of the German-Soviet border. The gas used on the eastern front was a mixture of the gas used in the gas chambers and the gas that was used to kill the Jews in the ghettos. The gasses used to gas the Jews were used in two different ways. The first method was to use the gas directly on the Jews. The second method used was to shoot the Jews to death. The Nazis used the first method because it was the most efficient way to kill them. The Jews were shot or gassed to death en masse, but they were forced to provide slave labor and they were used to provide medical experiments (see Human experimentation in Nazi Germany). The Soviets used the second method, which\n","golden answer: \n","\"In accordance with the Nazi cross-European policy of genocide against the Jews, the SS \"processed\" thousands of Romani people, (male) homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled, intellectuals and the clergy from all occupied territories.[4]\" The Nazi's murdered many millions of people, not all of whom were Jewish.\n","the question: \n","what was really the ethnic distribution of vilnius (wilno) in early xxth century?\n","prediction answer: \n","Vilnius was one of the most Polonized and Russified of Lithuanian cities during 1795-1914 Russian rule, with Lithuanians constituting a mere fraction of the total population: 2% - 2,6% according to Russian (1897), German (1916) and Polish (1919) censuses. According to the 1897 Russian census, by mother tongue, 40% of the population was Jewish, 31% Polish, 20% Russian, 4.2% Belarusian and 2.1% Lithuanian.\n","golden answer: \n","The ethnic composition of Vilnius (for convenience's sake, I'll just use Vilnius here, but keep in mind this city has many names: Wilno [Polish], Vilnia [Belorussian], Vilna [Russians and Jews]) is somewhat nebulous and defies an easy demographic answer. The Russian empire conducted a census in 1897 and the city had 152, 532 residents, of whom 40 percent were Jews, 31 percent Poles, 20 percent Russians, and 2.1 percent Lithuanians. These figures are deceptively precise. The census itself though was based upon \"native language\" and the tsarist officialdom was highly leery of the national question, which is why the number of \"Russians\" in the census is quite high as they enfolded both Ukrainian and Belorussians as part of the city's Russian community. Furthermore, the officials likely downplayed the number of Poles in the city as the anti-Polish sentiments of the tsarist state ensured that they would not accept any evidence of a Polandization outside of the borders of Congress Poland. This bias reflected itself in other tsarist era mapping projects wherein Polish/Catholic areas became erased or discounted. The census also precluded the existence of \"national amphibians\" who spoke multiple languages and for whom the issue of of national identity was much more malleable. The issue becomes even more cloudy given that the fact that nationality/ethnicity in Russia's Northwest and Western provinces were not fixed and still evolving at the turn of the century. This is perhaps best seen in the case of Vilnius's Jewish population, who could Russify, tap into the Polish activism and push for a position as Polish Jews, or argue that being a Jew was its own ethnic category distinct from other groups in the Northwest Provinces. The last option increasingly emerged as the dominant one as Jewish organizations emerged such as the socialist Bund or Zionism hat fostered such particularism. Yet this trend should not obscure the fact that ethnic identity was seldom clear-cut or innate. The 1897 census's low numbers of Lithuanian speakers reflects that \"Lithuanian\" itself was a very hazy concept for identity during this time. The area's surrounding Lithuanian national activists sought to project onto Vilnius a historical provenance that stretched back to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Like the tsarist state, these Lithuanian activists used a very skewed sense of statistics and ethnography to confirm their biases. Belorussian or Polish speakers were Lithuanians who simply spoke Polish by an accident of history in this schema. After the First World War, the Poles also employed a similiar methodology to project onto Vilnius a strong Polish identity. The long and short of it is there is no clear answer as much of the data on the city's ethnic composition reflected nationalist or state imperatives and grossly oversimplified or ignored the Vilnius's multiethnic reality. *Sources* Bartov, Omer, and Eric D.
